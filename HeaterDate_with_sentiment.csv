16-May-25,5,33.56,Cord overheats-fire hazard.,Cord is too light. Overheats. Product malfunction a year after buying leaving me stuck this early spring with no heat except a oil radiator type. It was the only thing on and luckily the breaker flipped. I was trying to just use it a few minutes at a time to try and baby it the rest of the season. Nope. If my breaker had not flipped it would have caught fire.,-0.3182

12-Apr-25,5,33.56,Great Little Heater,"I now own 3 of these heaters. I use them in the smaller rooms and it heats them up well. I tried it in a very large room but all it did was take the edge off the cold, it never really heated up the whole room. I typically leave it on full blast to heat up the room, then when it's a comfortable temperature, I turn down the thermostat and it will turn on and off as it maintains the temperature. The tip over feature works well, as soon as I pick it up to move it, or I tip it, it shuts off until I stabilize it again. It did have an odor when first running it, so I ran it outside for about an hour, and the smell was more tolerable, then as time went on the smell entirely went away. I find it easy to use, it's not too big, not too small, and looks like a typical Milkhouse heater.",0.9377

It throws off a loot of heat and (unlike the other heater) the thermostat WORKS!I had a unit pretty much exactly like this that I bought from Home Depot and it lasted three and a half years.

3-Mar-25,3,33.56,Small and not powerful but built well.,Overall for small spaces like a normal size bathroom this is ok and seemingly built well with metal casing and some plastic handles. It does not warm a garage per say or a 10 x 10 green house. I did however bring the plants and kenneled farm animals in closer together and made a temporary wall opposite of heater to help them through the low temps in the garage. It was warm enough to sustain them but. Still not as warm as expected. I decided to continue use of heat lamp with it Durning night temps. We had an emergency situation with our animals habitats being destroyed Durning recent storms. We bought this as it was a temporary emergent situation. Next year I will look for a larger option. I plan to try it in the camper and see if it would warm that area of space. It didn't work as planned in greenhouse or garage without improvisions.,-0.6164

It was quiet with the fan on but that's it. It has coils so I figured the coils would light up for heat but the only part that glowed was at the base of one coil and it was barely noticeable.

The plastic knobs are poorly shaped and slippery, and they seem difficult to turn with cold, arthritic hands.  I wrapped cloth hockey tape on my knobs to make them easier to grip, which obviates the problem.All heaters of this kind deliver a maximum 1500 watts of heat to a room, so all that matters otherwise is how well the heater distributes the heat.  This one seems to have a weaker fan than priors, which may be better or worse for heat distribution.

5-Dec-24,3,33.56,It works but with a few hiccups,"I live in a small studio condo with not enough either insulation or a small electric baseboard heater.  Comfort Zone Milkhouse heater to the rescue.  It took a while for it to get going, I was already thinking about a return when the heat started blowing. Yesss!! It works perfectly, heating up my small quarters.P.S. I don't worry about the electrical bill because all utilities are included in the monthly condo fee.Back to the heater. It has good features and not so good ones. I will begin with the goodpart. Overheat protection and tip-over protection. When I first set up my new milkhouse heater, I picked it up to look at the Cauton button, which is when the heater stopped working but started again once I set it on the floor.  I decided not to attach the handle because I don't intend to carry it around. Attaching the handle is easy, all you need is a flat screwdriver and 2 screws that are already in.  Maybe will attach when I am in the mood.BUT.  This heater is equipped with a 2-prong ever so slightly polarized plug. I am no electrician but am aware that everything nowadays has 3-prong plugs. All my antennae went up and I started researching which yielded a confirmation that a 2-prong plug is not safe.  It lacks a grounding prong crucial for safety. I have ended up unplugging it when not in use as per instructions.Both the plug and the cord get pretty warm when in use, and take some time to cool down. I really don't know what to think about this.  I hesitate to return the unit because I want to stay warm. One star off for that.There is another model currently on the market, Comfort Glow Milkhouse heater which is equipped with a 3-prong plug; unfortunately not offered here on Amazon.  One star off for that.By the way, I have ended up paying a few $$ more supposedly as a special for the prime members. Does this make sense? Actually the prime deal translated into receiving the heater a few days earlier; I wish that it was spelled out this way rather than referring to the prime.

22-May-25,5,39.19,2 years going strong,"I have had this heater for two years now.  It is still going strong.  I like that it has multiple temperature and fan/wattage settings.  The fan settings allow me to really pump up the heat when the lower setting isn't enough and it pumps out more heat.  The temperature setting is basically just a limit- so when the room gets to a certain temperature it turns off.  I like that I can adjust for what I want.  Produces a large volume of heat (I sit about 4 feet away at my desk).  Knobs are easy to use and heater is small and portable enough to re-locate if needed.This thing is a life saver for a cold office!  Even when my office was in the mid 30's one day, this thing made enough heat to keep me comfortable.",0.9531

Let me just say there are no other brands that compete in both the longevity and the efficiency. Like I am truly in shock that I’ve had it as long I have. I bought it my junior year of college and I have been an alumni for almost 5 years now.. It. Still. Works. If you were waiting for that IT review, this is your sign.

8-Jan-25,1,39.19,Lacks a Tip-over Safety,"I've had two of these for several months now.  This model has separate built-in thermostat control, and a high/low/fan control.  The controls work well, and the units are functioning normally despite near 24/7 use at low, and some use at high(though the thermostat does prevent continuous operation of the heating element and fan).I've not had either of mine shut off due to overheat, despite sometimes running on high for hours at a time.However, these units entirely lack a tip-over safety, and I find that alarming.  I'm not willing to test whether or not the overheat protection will engage prior to the unit setting external objects on fire, but this should not be something anyone ever has to worry about with an electric heater.  The things are dangerous enough without sufficient safety mechanisms built in.Though I'm pleased with this item overall, I would not buy it again, nor recommend anyone else buy one, for this reason alone.",-0.9083

Speaking of which, probably don't let your toddlers walk around this thing, and make sure it's a good distance from anything it's pointed at! I'm loving this heater! Depending on what my electric bill looks like, I might just get 1 or 2 more of these and say fk calling the HVAC guy to fix my furnace!

Simple, easy to use controls, an effective safety interlock to prevent tipping accidents, and an attractive appearance. You can choose to use it in the fan only mode, or in low or high heat output. We used it to supply supplemental heat to a 130 Sq Ft. bathroom during the winter months and were delighted with it's performance. Initially, it is very quiet, especially on the low fan speed setting. Even at the high speed fan setting it is noticeable but not objectionable, After several years of service it did develop a bearing rattle, but that was not annoying enough to warrent concern. A worthwhile investment, you won't be disappointed.",0.9544

It heats up slowly but gets so hot I’m concerned about the plastic melting or burning my fingers. Now, this ONLY happens when it’s on high - low is fine. And high is fine for maybe 15-30 minutes before the knob starts to get hot. But if I’d noticed this earlier, I’d have returned the heater.",0.8124

26-Feb-25,5,32.23,750 watt maximum setting prevents huge energy bills,"Nice heater, lovely stable design, takes the chill off at a very low wattage.  My priority was finding a heater that had a maximum of 750 watts but still worked for a smaller room okay. I notice that when I or guests use a space heater we automatically turn it on to the highest 1500 watt setting and then always forget to turn it lower when the room is warm. That's a huge energy bill increase if you forget about it.  I tried the smaller 500 watt Amazon Basics heater-- nice abut it was just a little too low-- I wanted to feel the heat when I entered my room as a signal that the heat was on.  This one does the job.  In small bedrooms or offices you just put it where the warm air blows toward you if you are working. When I open the door to the room, it feels warmer.  No, it does not heat the ""bones"" of the room and you can't get a room really hot with it, but it lets me work in my very poorly insulated study room with two walls of ancient drafty 1935 windows. When you walk in the room, you can feel the warm air.  This is meant to be used when you are near it and turned off when you're not, in my opinion. Good value for money.",0.9706

I use both to warm up my room in the morning, and then mainly keep this one on throughout the day as maintenance. I like how small but mighty it is, and that it doesn’t make a lot of background noise (I have to turn the other tall one off for work calls - too noisy).

16-Dec-24,5,32.23,"You've tried the rest, now try the best","Amazon offers dozens and dozens of small space heaters geared toward knocking off the chill in a small space.  The problem is that most of these small space heaters have small fans that run at higher RPM and produce a significant amount of sound and don't really move much air, so you get noise and it is very warm close to the heater, but still cold only a couple feet away.  In addition, most are not heat selectable, so they draw a large amount of current that can't be adjusted and in the office setting, you may not have enough current to run a 1000W-1500W space heater.  If that happens, then you'll trip the electrical breaker for your office and maybe a few adjoining ones.  Then you'll have the facilities people on your butt for having an unapproved electrical device.I drew the unlucky straw of getting the office at work with the cold air return for HVAC in it, so my office is cold all winter long.  So cold that it's referred to as The Beer Fridge.  Then in the summer, it turns into an oven.In desperation I bought one of the typical inexpensive heaters that drew 1250W and put it under my desk.  It was very warm under my desk, but took a very long time to make the office comfortable.  In addition, one cooler morning a coworker in the next office turned on a space heater also and it popped the breaker for 4 offices.  We were not very popular as the Facilities person was in a different building that morning and it took a couple hours until we had power in our offices again.So, time to look for a better space heater that had an adjustable heat setting and would move air better.  Something that was more fan than toaster oven. That is what the Vornado VH202 is.  It really moves a much larger quantity of air and it is quiet.  It is more a fan with a heating element than a space heater.  It is selectable for 375W or 750W, so I can avoid run-ins with Facilities and warms the whole office up instead of just creating a hot-spot under my desk.  As and added bonus, you can also run it in fan-only mode for those warmer days.The only thing missing in this model is a thermostat that some space heaters have.  Not a big thing for me as I never leave it running when not in my office, but if that feature is important to you, then look at some of Vornado's higher-end models.  Some even come with remotes and timers.",0.969
12-Dec-24,4,32.23,"Good, but I needed something stronger.","I’m giving this four stars because it’s a good product for its price, but it wasn’t enough for my 80 sq. ft. office. It’s super quiet and offers lower power usage than other heaters, but it’s also a small fan.I ended up upgrading to the MVH model, which is really just a big brother version of the VH202. At 750 watts, its lowest setting already felt warmer than the high setting of the VH202, which is also 750 watts. I think it heats better  from the bigger heating element and fan.Overall, the Vornado is a good brand to stick with, but just make sure you get the right model for your space.",0.9455
7-Dec-24,4,32.23,Small heater warms a small area,"Yes, it's small and makes enough heat to take the chill out of a cold room. I trust the Vornado brand as I've bought a couple in the past.

The larger one has a slightly larger slit where you can easily put your hand into when you want to move the heater.  I would have liked a little larger handle to use to move this one around. But all in all, I'd buy it again.",0.9387

I am fairly certain it is not the heating element.Normally plastic related stench disappears after a day or two, the other version was just a few hours.But definitely NOT the smell of anything burning.11/7 and it still stinks. The casing or something inside stinks of bad plastic. Heat didn't remove it, time didn't remove it. How does it still stink?It works but the stench refuses to leave. Leave it in the sun? Sit it outside?I wiped it down, burned it on both settings and ran it on fan.

And I have put a scented air freshener in front of it to add a little “something”. LOL.Others in the office have now huddled in to my cubicle to w up! So it has become a movement!

The office, which had been used as a family room prior, had many windows and an exterior door, and there was no basement below it. The room was heated with a wall-mounted gas Rinai heater and always felt cold, especially the floor, but with the added ISILER space heater, the entire room felt comfortable!

The ETL certification adds an extra layer of trust in its safety and quality.My only drawback is the noise level. While not overly disruptive, it’s noticeable enough to detract from the experience, particularly in quieter settings. If you’re sensitive to noise, this might be something to consider.Overall, the ISILER Space Heater delivers excellent performance and safety features, making it a solid choice despite the noise.

2-Feb-24,5,39.99,Great for Small Space Emergencies,"After I visited family for the holidays, I came back home to a broken heater unit in one room. Try as I might, my heater in the other room just wouldn't heat up my bedroom too. I didn't get to have anybody scheduled to come fix the heater until mid-February (6 weeks after the heater stopped), and I wasn't willing to sit in the cold.In came this little beastie!! For reference, my bedroom is roughly 12x13 ft and this little heater gets the room cozy. If you close the door and turn the heat up, you can get a really solid heat going on. If you just want some casual, cozy, I'm-pretending-I-have-a-fireplace vibes, turn the temperature knob down and enjoy the warmth in your little corner. Don't sit too close to it, because it can pack a punch.There's a little button/lever on the bottom of the heater that depresses when it's on the floor. If you pick up or move the heater and that button releases, the heater automatically turns off. If you're worried about it tipping over, it's very stable, but rest assured that it does turn off immediately. The handle on top is also easy to hold and has never been hot to touch for me.Bonus: I bought the green version and it almost perfectly matches the color of my desk. Very cute!",0.9706

23-Jan-24,5,39.99,Great Little Heater,I’m so impressed with this portable heater. It provides a lot of heat. I’ve been using it in my office at home. I live near the ocean so it gets really chilly here. I also love its size and portability. And it’s cute!,0.8976
23-Jan-24,5,39.99,This heater is awesome,Bought this thing to prepare for the cold. Man it is relaxing-quiet-and cute to look at. Puts off enough heat if you’re lounging in your room or living room. Will buy another soon,0.4588
22-Jan-24,5,39.99,🔥🔥🔥,Love the power to this little thing. It’s definitely got a noise (listen to video) but it’s to be expected for how quickly it produces heat. Creates a breeze which helps get the heat into the room. Has a safety toggle at the bottom in case it were to get knocked over. Love the little handle to easily move!,0.9651
22-Jan-24,1,39.99,JUNK and fire hazard. Dangerous.,"I purchased two of these to help knock the chill off in my garage. At first they seemed to be pretty ok, nothing impressive, but after 2 uses (not at full power) the fan quit working on one, so I decided to send it back. I figured it was a fluke, so I planned to keep the other. I needed to move it to another space and when I went to unplug it I found that it had melted to the receptacle meaning I narrowly escaped a house fire. DO NOT BUY",0.238
21-Jan-24,4,39.99,Better looking than most. Effective.,"The enclosed, covered porch connecting my garage to my house requires a space heater when it gets really cold. They are always an eyesore. This one is less so and seems to be effective so far. I put it on an open shoe shelf and it is pretty inconspicuous.",0.743
21-Jan-24,4,39.99,Small but keeps us warm,"This heater is tiny but the area I'm heating stays toasty warm, it is a powerful little heater and so far is working without any problems, when this one stops working I'll probably buy another I guess size really doesn't matter. The seller offered a refund because of my initial reaction to its size but I'll keep it. Sorry I jumped to conclusions.",0.7234
20-Jan-24,1,39.99,Just plain wrong,"I ordered three of these which were supposed to be ceramic heaters, but they are not. They are electric coil heaters, and only one of the three works!

19-Jan-24,5,39.99,Perfect for our greenhouse,"This heater is perfect for our greenhouse.  It is sturdy with a metal frame and is stable which removes the worry of a turnover.  Plus, it has a turnover safety feature so really is worry free.  The thermostat dial allows for temperature control and you just have to decide where to set that based on outside temps.  It puts out a good amount of heat and as an example, it keeps our 100sqft greenhouse (which has lots of leaky windows) around 60 degrees F on nights where the outside temp is 30F.  It also kept it around 50F on a night that dropped to about 18F recently.",0.8326
19-Jan-24,5,39.99,Fabulous comes in small!,I have been keeping plants in my double size garage during a cold snap but my space heater wasn’t providing much heat so on a whim I bought this and WOW.  Who knew this little gem would work so good!  Absolutely amazed!,0.9644

17-Jan-24,5,39.99,Tiny but mighty,"This little guy is amazing. I have no central heat in my home and typically use the cute little heaters that look like little fireplaces. Well I'd had them several years and one decided to crap out on me 3 days before we were set to get a winter storm and temps as low as -6°. I ordered this one and a Lasko one and the day they arrived and the day before the storm hit, the other heater I had died. So I've just had these 2 for the kitchen, living room, one bathroom and bedroom and we have been perfectly comfortable. It's currently -4° as I'm writing this and it feels lovely in here. I put it on a concrete stepping stone so it has a little elevation because I'm paranoid of a cat toy getting in front of it. It has a little thing on the bottom that will depress if it's knocked over and will shut it off. Avocado for size reference!",0.8294
17-Jan-24,5,39.99,Tip sensor failed —> RESOLVED,"Updated review (see original below) - So the tip over sensor in my heater failed in the “on” position, so the fan would stay on even if tipped. It got progressively worse after my original review and ended up melting part of the assembly on the inside that the tip sensor wires plugged into. I cut the wires and bypassed the tip sensor altogether. I STRONGLY recommend against doing this!! My heater is being used to heat a small greenhouse and poses almost no fire risk and even if it did start a fire, it would be sequestered to a safe area. That being said, I strongly believe that the malfunction I had was a fluke and not something that in and of itself could have caused a fire. Otherwise, this is a fantastic little forced air heater. FWIW, if you’re handy, it wouldn’t be difficult at all to upgrade the fan inside of it to a stronger/better fan since it’s a computer sized fan, do that at your own risk though. Despite my issue, I still liked this heater enough to originally give it three stars. I’m changing it to five because of the customer service. I never reached out to them because I assumed it would go the way most other negative Amazon experiences tend to go and I ultimately had a working fan. However, iSiler reached out to me to offer me a full refund of the product with a genuine apology. It didn’t feel too much like a cookie cutter response and they aren’t making me jump through hoops to receive the refund. The fact they went out of their way to get me my money back says an enormous amount about the business, and I’ll 100% buy any products they carry that I need from them in the future if they have it.——original review——Pretty okay little heater for the cost. It seems to be about average in noise production, but I think it stands out from the rest in its class aesthetically. My only problem with it is that the little button on the bottom failed in the “fan on” position. Not the button itself, it still moves up and down, but the fan doesn’t turn off.",-0.3247
16-Jan-24,4,39.99,This easily portable heater quickly warms a room.,"I need to save money on my home heating.  It makes sense to limit heat to the room I’ll occupy for an hour or so- hence, a room heater.  This Isiler 1500 watt heated my 10x15’ room within 30 mins. It shuts down (not off) when you lift it.  The bottom gets warm so I’m going to rest it on a wooden surface if I raise it off the floor/carpet.  It makes a low humming sound while running.  Turning the back knob regulates the heat - adding temperature markers would be helpful.  Tho I‘ve had this item less than 24 hours, I’m satisfied I purchased it.",0.8225

15-Jan-24,2,39.99,Sucker and a Quitter,"Initially I loved this little heater.  Small unit to heat up the freezing bathroom in the dead of winter and it blew a ton of heat quickly.  I was also looking for a unit that was NOT digital so that it might last longer.  I sucked a ton of electricity.  I could only turn on one lamp in the room without blowing the circuit.  Usually wasn't too much of an issue since I was just heating one small space for a short period of time.  Then, it totally died after only 2 seasons.",-0.8268

The only off switch, like other people in the reviews are saying melted and will no longer turn the heater on or off. Contemplated changing the switch but I believe it wouldn't last very long again. Undersized wiring maybe? I'm not a electrical engineer, but the days seem to be numbered on how long the switch lasts.",0.0387

14-Jan-24,3,39.99,"Cute, warm, but loud","I like the way this thing looks, and it’s certainly effective at heating the room, but it’s the loudest space heater I’ve ever owned. It’s clearly got a very small fan running at high speed.Mind you, it’s not deafening or anything, but I generally expect a space heater to be essentially silent from across the room. My watch picks up about 53 dB from 10 feet away, compared to my room’s 40 dB background noise. It’s also loud enough to notice over the background noise I sleep with at night.",0.9144
13-Jan-24,2,39.99,Redesigned heater is loud and unsafe,"I purchased three previous models of this heater, and they were the best heaters I have ever purchased.  But Isiler redesigned the heater in these two irritating ways:  (1) The previous model only emitted a low whirring sound with the fan motor.  This new model emits a high-pitched sound in addition to the whirrling sound.  (2) The previous model included two small feet in the front that raised the heater so that air could get underneath it, so the surface where it sat did not get hot.  This new model removed the two feet so the heater rests solely on the surface where it sits.  This is undesirable, and I have to place something metal in the front of the new heaters so the bottom can breathe.  I will not buy another of these new models and will try to find old models.",-0.714
11-Jan-24,5,39.99,Excellent space heater,"I ordered the iSiLER small mint green colored space heater from Amazon - it is perfect!! I use it to heat the kitchen while I’m prepping food, to keep me warm on the floor doing yoga, and sometimes while watching TV or reading in the evening. It’s so warm I can usually heat the space in a few minutes - especially if I’m moving around.The design is modern and streamlined - looks great in my house… The housing stays cool so if you touch the sides, top, bottom, you don’t get burned. The automatic cut-off works well - stops if it is tipped or knocked over.This heater is a great value. I highly recommend it!!",0.9798

In a pinch, we have used a 1500 watt inverter (powered off the truck) to easily power it.  Also have used a small gas generator which powers it just off idle speed so its not very noisy.

7-Jan-24,5,31.99,Great Little Heater,"So to preface this review I bought this for in front of my dogs little sofa/couch/bed thing that he lays on. I like to crack a window in the window for fresh air and we keep his fur short so I want him to be comfortable with warm. Even with blankets I want him to stay cozy, and feel that if he needs to warm up he can. I grabbed this lil guy for my pupper and it's perfect. It's slightly bigger than two iphones put together and outputs enough heat to just keep you very comfy. When he was walking around I sat in front of it and was actually quite impressed. So I may grab another one for myself hah. It doesn't burn, or pump out 200 degree heat, which is a huge plus for me. While it doesn't flamethrow magma levels of heat and burn you, it's very solid to keep you at a perfect comfy warm level of warm. Huge plus for me, again as i'm normally always burning up even when cold. Safety features are standard and nice, in case it does knock over you won't burn your home down, and the look of it is very nice. I got the blue color and the gold hardware on the blue heater looks very upscaled and classy. I could easily see this on an office desk, or at your feet as way to keep your toes warm. The power cord is about 3 feet, so you may need to get an extension chord. It also has a cool setting that blows a bit of cold air at you which might be nice to use as a way to dry a painting, or your nails, which i'll eventually try. It's also super lightweight and the build quality feels durable. I'd highly recommend it.",0.9951

I think they forgot to put the motor in it.😆 and I have a 25 minute drive to return it. 25 minutes back a lot of time wasted Someone should check out the merchandise and make sure it works before sending it to a good customer,0.6732
24-Nov-23,5,31.99,Definitely puts out heat,"I got this for my desk in my home office. This definitely has kept me warm in my home office when I work at home. I love the look and color. There is a safety feature that if the heater gets tipped, it automatically will shut off. After running for a while, the outside has not gotten extremely hot either.",0.9006

7-Nov-23,1,31.99,This is going right back.,"This heater is cute and a very nice color.  That's about the only positive things I can say about it, though. It took moving it to several different surfaces before it would even start to run.  As several people have indicated in reviews, the safety button beneath the heater has to be engaged before the heater will work.  The button must be too short otherwise it should work on any flat surface it is set upon.  Once I got this heater to turn itself on, I left it running for about 20-25 minutes in a small, closed bedroom.  After that time, the room was not at all noticeably warmer.  More alarming, there was an odd odor coming from the heater.  Much more alarming, the black grill on the front of the machine was scorching hot.  I accidently brushed my fingers on it and was sorry I did.  Safety feature or not, if this heater were to fall over, I believe it might cause a fire or seriously injure someone who innocently touched it.  As soon as this thing cooled down, it was in the box and on its way back to Amazon.",0.9326
2-Nov-23,1,31.99,doesn’t work like they said,this is not good for camping like they advertise . they say you can hang this in the tent but you have to tape the safety button to get it to work .for 30$ you have to tape a button for the heater to work what’s wrong here that they think this is ok ?,0.3393

1-Nov-23,4,31.99,Keeps my mouse hand warm!,"I got this to put on my desk to keep my mouse hand warm and it works wonderfully. I don't really get any heat on the lowest setting, but the middle setting is great- too hot if the heater is too close. I've never had to use the high setting. I also move it down to the floor if my feet are cold and it warms them nicely. And it's super cute sitting on my desk.",0.9766
1-Nov-23,4,31.99,Lots of heat in a little package,I finally needed to pull this out of the box today. My office gets chilly and I wanted something that would fit on my desk to warm my poor cold fingers as I type. This definitely packs a punch! It take a couple minutes to warm up but once it does it's great.The only issue I've had is the safety button on the bottom. There's a cylinder-shaped plastic piece that comes out of the bottom and for the heater to activate it has to be pressed in - this allows it to shut off quickly if it's knocked over. Great feature but mine doesn't go low enough to touch the desk!!!  My work around was to fold up a sticky note underneath it to hit that button. Luckily the exterior plastic part doesn't get hot.,0.9676
31-Oct-23,5,31.99,We absolutely love it!!!,"We absolutely love this little heater. It's cute, quiet, and despite it's compact size it puts out enough heat to perfectly warm our 19ft travel trailer. I highly recommend this product.",0.9444

This is my second one, the first arrived broken. The small emergency shut off on the bottom isn’t long enough with the feet in the design, so it doesn’t stay on. Also, it fell over and half of the plastic on the front broke off instantly, like very easily. Literally fell over on my desk when the cord got caught on something and broke.",-0.7994
31-Oct-23,5,31.99,"Warmth, Efficiency, and Charm - A Heater That's a Game Changer!","I recently purchased this small indoor heater to warm my feet as I work in my office. I couldn't be happier with my choice. This heater has truly exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, the heating options are fantastic. With three different modes, it's incredibly versatile. Whether you need a quick blast of warmth on those colder days or just a gentle breeze on warmer ones, this heater has you covered. The safety features are also a big plus. The automatic shutoff when it's knocked over or reaches a high temperature provides peace of mind that I greatly appreciate.One of the standout features of this heater is its speed. It heats up my small space lightning fast, and it's virtually silent. No annoying fan noise to disrupt my concentration or my sleep. It's perfect for a cozy night in, reading, or just getting some well-deserved rest.Size matters, and this heater is both compact and powerful. It fits perfectly in my office or bedroom. It's not just a heater; it's a stylish piece that adds a touch of retro charm to my space. I've even considered buying more as gifts for friends and family, and the upcoming holiday season seems like the perfect occasion!This little indoor heater is a five-star addition to my life. It's functional, safe, fast, and quiet - all in a chic, compact package. I can't recommend it enough, and I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I do.

3-Oct-23,4,31.99,Cuts the Cold,"This little heater is perfect for my hybrid, roaming work schedule.  I work in different offices around town and being able to put this in my bag is a lifesaver, especially since I tend to get cold easily.  I put it on the floor of the office, close the door and it heats up the entire room, plus keeps my toes and legs really warm.  It does the same thing if you put it on the desk, but it does kick out a fair amount of heat so make sure it's not too close.  I like that the first switch is just a cool flow of air so if the opposite were ever true and I need circulation this would work too (it's not really cold).  Very stylish, easy to use, only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is that the chord is not that long, but it works in a pinch.",0.9786

28-Sep-23,2,31.99,Does not work without taping up the rollover switch.,"On the bottom of the heater, as with most heaters, there is a switch that has to be pressed in for the heater to work. However, the switch is not as long as the legs of the heater - so the switch is never pressed in.  The only way to make this work is to put something under the heater between the legs in just the right spot, or to tape closed the safety rollover switch.That said, once you tape closed the switch, everything works as advertised. Nice little heater at that point.",0.6808
27-Sep-23,3,31.99,Emits a smell when in use.,"This device emits a weird heating up of plastic smell when on level 2. I bought this for my cat so he can warm himself up but he makes gagging expressions when approaching it (if you don’t know cats, thats how a cat reacts to a smell they don’t like). I checked it out and it lets off an pungent melting plastic smell.Unfortunately, I had to return it. Its cute looking and heats up fairly quickly with little to no noise at level 2. I didn't try level 3 though.",0.7269
24-Sep-23,4,31.99,"Well built, looks good and is easy to carry around","For its size, it puts out a lot of heat. It will get a small room or office warm fairly quick. A couple of complaints are the shutoff switch at the bottom seems a bit short, so it triggers off very easy unless it is completely level and the power cable is rather short. I had to compromise a bit when trying to find a good place to put it.",0.6478

I was happy with it being on 1 since it was placed fairly close to me but you can adjust the setting based on the distance. Being portable and easy to carry from one place to other as long as you have place to plug it in. And it looks so pretty( reminded me of small radios but the color and design is beautiful)!

Because this automatically turns off (even when on high and full blast) I forget that it's actually on and still plugged in, which is more problematic than just being able to turn it off because i'm at the correct temperature.

Use a smart plug as a timer.  The power light is very dim in daylight and not at all useful.  I have never been able to set the thermostat properly.

There's one thing that's not mentioned and that it has an automatic thermostat. when you set the thermostat at a setting, it will turn off and on dependent upon the temperature in the room. The lower the setting, the better it does this. Even in the ""off"" setting, it will still come on and off if the temperature falls below that setting.  Also, it runs cool and has many safety features the others do not. The plug never runs hot in the wall outlet. So, from that perspective it's safe as well.  You should still never leave it on when you're not present as with all heaters for common safety, it's still the safest, toughest, well-built space heater if seen. When the one I have finally dies in the future, 12 years going strong, I will no doubt by another one for another 12 years!",0.9724

My second one has run for more than 3 hours every evening in the fall and winter to take the chill out of my home office, and has been just as reliable.  It probably has ""only"" about 5,000 hours on it.  I only run them on the 750W setting to avoid tripping any circuit breakers.No complaints here at all.

It was used about 6 hours daily at high heat setting through May, stored throughout the summer, and I've been using it again on and off for the last month. Starting about a week ago, I started smelling a very strong burnt wiring / circuitry smell, on both low and high heat settings.

I cannot complain about the heat this product puts out---it's excellent. The fan is stronger than most heaters of this size, and it pumps out very hot air.But the thing I cannot get by is that it STINKS! I mean, it smells like a cross between a burning cigarette and bug spray. I put it out on our back porch and turned it on. Over a period of two days, I let it run out there for about six hours in total. I was hoping the smell would dissipate, but it didn't. All the hot air it blows out spreads the smell throughout the room you're trying to heat. I hate returning things, but this one is going back to Amazon.",0.5126

17-Jan-24,1,33.77,Don't Buy This Defective Product!!!,"I ordered this electric heater on December 25 2023. It finally arrived on January 17.When I plugged the heater into an outlet, the red power indicator light turned on even though I hadn't yet turned it on to the fan, low or high setting. The manual for this product states: ""The power indicator light turns on when either FAN, LOW or HIGH setting is selected.""This product is clearly defective, wired incorrectly and is likely in violation of UL electrical standards.  I called the manufacturer Black and Decker. When I described the malfunction, the customer support person told me that the heater is defective and directed me to return it to Amazon. I suspect that this is not a one-off problem but more likely a manufacturing defect affecting this model of electric heater. I returned the heater to Amazon but asked for a replacement. The replacement heater had the same defect, so it is a systemic defect.",-0.839

I am returning and buying a different brand.Additional information: feet are too high to allow safety disk on bottom to be fully depressed.

It has a fan setting and two heat settings. Worth every penny. The first one we have, I got a few years ago and still works just as well.",0.9438

18-Nov-23,1,33.77,Stopped working about 5 weeks after purchase (right after the return window).,"This was actually great for a month. Then, about 5 weeks after purchase, it caused tripped a circuit (I can still run a larger more energy-intensive space heater from that outlet, while heating a curling iron and blow drying my hair, so this is not a wiring issue at all). Then, a week later, the unit just shut itself off and never came back on. Would like to get a refund. Black and Decker is a respectable brand. Have other small appliances from them. This is probably a lemon. But nonetheless. It lasted only 5 weeks",0.6428
16-Nov-23,4,33.77,Think fridge fan for noise level.,"Very effective heating and safety functions. It runs at roughly 45 dB, and sounds similar to a refrigerator fan. In a living room, its noise would likely fade into the background, but in a very quiet office, it may distract colleagues.",0.2374
15-Nov-23,2,33.77,Poor design.,"The feet prevent the sensor button from coming on. I had to gold up the pamphlet that came with the heater,into fourths to place under the sensor button just to get it to come on. I had purchased another heater from your company.

11-Nov-23,1,33.77,Works When It Wants to OR With  a Little Abuse OR Some Jerry-Rigging,"I received delivery of this heater yesterday (11/10/23) and it did NOT work properly from day one.It heated for about 10 minutes (IF you don't touch it, bump it); then turned off. I mean all the way off---the indicator light goes out also.I unplugged/re-plugged the unit---nothing. I readjusted the ON/OFF and temperature knobs--nothing. I unplugged/re-plugging, turned the temperature knob to ""Min"" setting, the ON/OFF switch to ""Off"", and waited for 1, 5, 10...minutes--NOTHING!For some unknown reason, I decided to shake and tap the unit on a hard surface and, the indicator light turned on, and the heating cycle began.I'm thinking something is loose inside the unit housing. Since this item is on the low end; I didn't have high expectations. I did hope it would satisfy the basic requirement of providing some heat...consistently for a few days...maybe a couple of weeks.  But, I believe I have a defective product and, I'll be sending it back. No, I  do not recommend this product.UPDATE:I discovered what the issue was/is with this heater. There is a problem with the 'button' on the bottom of the unit that controls the 'tip-over' safety feature. The 'button' does not appear to be fully extended so that it rests on the surface it's resting. So, it's always up and away from the surface and thinks the unit has been tipped thus, the unit will NOT start --- it's in perpetual shutdown mode. What I had to do was find something to place on the resting surface (my desk), under the 'tip-over' button.This is not how this product is supposed to operate. So, no, my rating (of one (1)) is still valid. I cannot recommend this product.",-0.8451
11-Nov-23,1,33.77,Fire hazard!,I just ordered this heater last week and already the knob on this heater started melting and burning. I've had heaters in the past that have lasted for years. This is made so poorly that it cannot handle its own heat. I will never buy one made of plastic again I am going to go back and look for one that's made out of metal.,0
6-Nov-23,1,33.77,SAFETY SWITCH TOO CONSCIENTIOUS!  WON'T ALLOW UNIT TO TURN ON - EVEN WITH UNIT UPRIGHT.,"Well, it does seem to be  VERY SAFE since IT WON'T EVEN TURN ON!  I turned on both dials - the fan and the heat up to High, and I checked the outlet to make sure it was working.  The first heater I received would not turn on at all; even the light wouldn't come on.  The replacement Amazon sent me also would not come on even though the fan was turned on and heat dial was turned up to high.  However, if I press the safety button all the way in, the unit will actually blow out hot air.  Did the factory workers not understand the instructions about how to install the safety switch?  Another reviewer said her husband had to put a piece of cardboard under the safety switch to get hers to work.  Is it safe to do that?",0.9759
