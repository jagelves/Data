I have had it for around a month now and it has really changed my living experience.

Low cost to run very efficient. Purchased one of these as an add-on for another Amazon product over 15 years ago, was in the low to mid $20. range. Tho a different model, runs exactly the same is as powerful and heats as well if not better. Also has a fan function which cools personal space nicely.Heater worked perfectly until the heating dial fell off and got lost. Had to turn with pliers and broke while twisting.Replaced with a Comfort Zone lookalike which ran from midOctober to midFeb, 4 mos and suddenly stopped working. Cold weather has lingered so decided to try this one again. Price is a bit higher $30. but still a bargain considering how long ago other one was purchased.Between high to low there are 11 settings. I estimate each to be approx 2 degrees. The lowest setting off w thermostat only on, 60ish, highest 80ish.

Low cost to run very efficient. Purchased one of these as an add-on for another Amazon product over 15 years ago, was in the low to mid $20. range. Tho a different model, runs exactly the same is as powerful and heats as well if not better. Also has a fan function which cools personal space nicely.Heater worked perfectly until the heating dial fell off and got lost. Had to turn with pliers and broke while twisting.Replaced with a Comfort Zone lookalike which ran from midOctober to midFeb, 4 mos and suddenly stopped working. Cold weather has lingered so decided to try this one again. Price is a bit higher $30. but still a bargain considering how long ago other one was purchased.Between high to low there are 11 settings. I estimate each to be approx 2 degrees. The lowest setting off w thermostat only on, 60ish, highest 80ish.

So far, this unit has been performing well. The tip-over safety is a spring-actuated button that is depressed by the weight of the unit. So if it falls over, the spring releases a switch somewhere and power is immediately cut. On the shelf I have the unit located, this button isn't a problem, but I will admit it makes the unit feel a little more ""tippy"" than one might expect. It's not very heavy, and the spring makes it feel even less so. This may be fixable by reducing the spring k-factor or centering the button more within the unit, as it's location is biased a bit toward one corner. (Note: manufacturer potential changes; I don't recommend trying to do this yourself). I don't consider this a major detriment, as you shouldn't put a heater on an unstable surface anyway, but be aware that some solid footing underneath is a good idea and keep it out of the way of potential traffic or flying objects. Again, if it does tip, the power cutoff is immediate.The thermostat seems to work well, and was the primary reason I selected this product (along with included safeties). As previously mentioned, it keeps the room it's in at a consistent 5-8°F warmer than the rest of the home when left on the partial power setting. It took some experimenting with the thermostat position, as it doesn't have temperature markings on it, but about 30-35% of full scale is where I have it set. That seems to be ~70°F control temperature for the room size and R-value. It also implies there is a fair amount of margin to run the unit harder than I am.One more thing to note is that it says right on the box, in slightly different words, that this unit is not meant to run a high duty cycle. I don't think it would work well in large rooms or in something like a hunting blind that's very drafty/open to outside. It's meant for relatively small rooms with relatively small heat losses so it doesn't have to run 100% of the time. I haven't tested the over-temperature function yet, and don't really intend to. Generally, relying on the safety limit isn't a good plan anyway.Long story short, for a smaller room that just needs warmed up a bit, this works well.

Well, there are literally 'hundreds' of space heaters to select from - while it is great to have so many options it makes selecting one very difficult.  I searched for several days and could not make a selection for one reason or another - everything from dead on arrival to safety issues, poor construction quality, too large etc..  Finally I focused in on the Pro Breeze 1500W Mini Ceramic Space Heater - I liked the heating element, thermostat and 2 levels of heating - I also liked the simplistic design, small footprint and it just looked good.

Well, there are literally 'hundreds' of space heaters to select from - while it is great to have so many options it makes selecting one very difficult.  I searched for several days and could not make a selection for one reason or another - everything from dead on arrival to safety issues, poor construction quality, too large etc..  Finally I focused in on the Pro Breeze 1500W Mini Ceramic Space Heater - I liked the heating element, thermostat and 2 levels of heating - I also liked the simplistic design, small footprint and it just looked good.

I was concerned about my pet so I ran it in my garage. It took a lot longer than the information said, but the smell did go away. I've enjoyed the heater since. On high it does a nice job and of warming up an average sized room. In a larger space you'll really want it pointed at you. The tip over feature works really well. The screen does get warmer than I would like so use caution if you have curious pets or kids.

I was concerned about my pet so I ran it in my garage. It took a lot longer than the information said, but the smell did go away. I've enjoyed the heater since. On high it does a nice job and of warming up an average sized room. In a larger space you'll really want it pointed at you. The tip over feature works really well. The screen does get warmer than I would like so use caution if you have curious pets or kids.

The problem is that most of these small space heaters have small fans that run at higher RPM and produce a significant amount of sound and don't really move much air, so you get noise and it is very warm close to the heater, but still cold only a couple feet away.  In addition, most are not heat selectable, so they draw a large amount of current that can't be adjusted and in the office setting, you may not have enough current to run a 1000W-1500W space heater.  If that happens, then you'll trip the electrical breaker for your office and maybe a few adjoining ones.  Then you'll have the facilities people on your butt for having an unapproved electrical device.I drew the unlucky straw of getting the office at work with the cold air return for HVAC in it, so my office is cold all winter long.

It only took a few business days for the heater to arrive.  It is currently sitting on my desk and working perfectly.Thanks Vornado!------This is the third Vornado VH202 heater I have purchased.  The first one died after 3 years, the second is great and my wife uses it often.  However, the third one which sits on my desk and never moves has developed issues.  The fan blades used to spin around without touching anything inside the case.  Now when I turn the heater on, the fan blades scrape the front grill and make a terrible noise.  Sometimes after startup the noise goes away.  I guess the blades balance out and move away from the grill.

It never dips below freezing in the metro areas except on the rare occasion. Knowing this I didnt want to go all out on a ~1500watt heater for two reasons. I dont need a whole room heater and I dont wish to play pop the circuit since the wiring here is awful.These little personal heater is exactly what its designed to be; a small, under or on desk source of warmth. The highest power setting is around 700watts, so half of a full sized heater. The heat it does put it out is quite nice however, on high you can just leave you feet near it without too hot. As some others have stated the air is only warm for about a foot or two then it dissipates. Again, not a con for me since its on my desk or nightstand when I use it.The fan has a mild sound to it, nothing worse than any other small heater Ive had. Its probably on the same sound level, but the sound itself is ""softer"", ie the air sounds free flowing versus being forced through a radiator.However, Im still giving it 3 stars for a couple of issues.-The fan motor is not balanced or balanced like garbage. At points during usage it begins to vibrate and move about on hard surfaces. Sometimes a quick tap/thump on the case will sort it but other times it just has to work itself out. Not sure if this is a shipping issue or just a bearing issue but after reading complaints about fan noise I believe its a design flaw/oversight. Im going to let itself run for a bit, maybe the bearings were dry and see what happens. If not I will return it, there is no reason for a simple and small fan not be balanced.-The second reason is more of a nitpick. Its only ETL rated, not the more stringent UL which for something like this I would prefer.Update: The motor has only gotten worse, it still walks about periodically and this morning the entire unit failed.

It never dips below freezing in the metro areas except on the rare occasion. Knowing this I didnt want to go all out on a ~1500watt heater for two reasons. I dont need a whole room heater and I dont wish to play pop the circuit since the wiring here is awful.These little personal heater is exactly what its designed to be; a small, under or on desk source of warmth. The highest power setting is around 700watts, so half of a full sized heater. The heat it does put it out is quite nice however, on high you can just leave you feet near it without too hot. As some others have stated the air is only warm for about a foot or two then it dissipates. Again, not a con for me since its on my desk or nightstand when I use it.The fan has a mild sound to it, nothing worse than any other small heater Ive had. Its probably on the same sound level, but the sound itself is ""softer"", ie the air sounds free flowing versus being forced through a radiator.However, Im still giving it 3 stars for a couple of issues.-The fan motor is not balanced or balanced like garbage. At points during usage it begins to vibrate and move about on hard surfaces. Sometimes a quick tap/thump on the case will sort it but other times it just has to work itself out. Not sure if this is a shipping issue or just a bearing issue but after reading complaints about fan noise I believe its a design flaw/oversight. Im going to let itself run for a bit, maybe the bearings were dry and see what happens. If not I will return it, there is no reason for a simple and small fan not be balanced.-The second reason is more of a nitpick. Its only ETL rated, not the more stringent UL which for something like this I would prefer.Update: The motor has only gotten worse, it still walks about periodically and this morning the entire unit failed. Nothing smells burnt or appears damaged, the orange warning light is lit so probably a fuse inside has failed. Im on the fence about replacing or returning it, its a nice design but it just feels cheap and apparently is also made with cheap components."

Either that or I stop noticing it. The odor is no big deal at all.YES, it makes a little noise. Come-on folks... it's a fan in a plastic housing, not the AC in a Lexus. As with the odor, the noise is minimal. It does not distract me as I work. After a few minutes I don't realize its on until I turn it off at 5:00.This fan is another excellent value doing exactly what it is designed to do."

It was my wife who, while I turned my back for five minutes, decided it would be fun to have a heater looking like a memento from bad old times. Indeed, this industrial style was very common in the Soviet Union some fifty years ago. And fun it was! I vividly recalled those days, though I do not think that was what the manufacturer intended.As one could expect from this not-really-consumer-but-rather-industrial design, this heater is not for weaklings. It requires some assembly, which should have been easy except for… Just like about any consumer product in USSR, from a bookshelf to a car, the assembly is not as straightforward as the manual suggests.First, I could not insert the tabs of the supporting stand into the cutouts in the unit's bottom. When I looked closely, I realized that one of the cutouts was obstructed by some inner part, see the picture. Reluctantly, I decided to remove the casing and see what was wrong with the inner assembly. Not big deal! Just unscrew eight screws at the sides of the unit. Now I could see that the piece overlapping with the hole was a plastic lug intended to interlock with the stand tab. There are two of them on each side of the plastic chassis, which itself is attached to the bottom of the casing. Unfortunately, the chassis was off to one side, so that one tab would not catch the lug, while the other would not allow to push the tab through the cutout in the bottom. Since I came that far… Releasing two more screws which hold the chassis to the bottom, pushing the stand in and adjusting it, making sure the tabs are securely interlocked with the lugs, and tightening the bottom screws. Almost there. Screwing on the upper part of the casing, and… The whole unit is skewed; it stands on three points instead of all four, and toggles slightly on the flat surface. We-ell… After all, it makes sense because I had to stress the construction when I forced the chassis to the middle of the bottom to align the lugs with the holes. Do you know how to fix it? I do. Loosen all screws, ask my wife to lean over the unit to slightly overcompensate the existing skew, and tighten the screws in this position. After releasing the tension, the unit is perfectly right. Ugh!After all these exercises, the heater is now totally OK. It is just as powerful as any other heater on the market, the same 1.5 kW, but much smaller than most of them. The cord is soft, and the wire gauge seems to be right, so the cord does not get warm. I would prefer this heater to have a 3-pole plug and cord to ground the metal heater casing, but not all our wishes are granted.All in all, I would give this heater three stars for the assembly quality that badly needs improvement. My wife is still thrilled by its appearance of a toy-sized version of a full-grown industrial thing and suggests five stars. So, four stars it gets.P.S. Assembly hint.

It arrived fully assembled and ready-to plug in.  It is compact, sturdy, and available in fun colors, which tend to match other products we own that are sold by Isiler. The noise level from the fan is on par with other brands of the same size space heaters we have used in the past.  The tip-over safety button on the bottom of the heater box triggered immediately and consistently when pressure was relieved from sitting solidly on a flat surface.  It is uncomplicated to operate – you turn it on, set the dial for desired temperature level, and enjoy.  The space heater puts out a level of warmth like two other similar size space heaters that we own and did not over-heat the floor directly in front of it.  As a caution – the front grill gets very hot when the heater is operating (as our two other different brands of space heaters do). We would not use any space heater in the vicinity of small children or pets without constant supervision.

It arrived fully assembled and ready-to plug in.  It is compact, sturdy, and available in fun colors, which tend to match other products we own that are sold by Isiler. The noise level from the fan is on par with other brands of the same size space heaters we have used in the past.  The tip-over safety button on the bottom of the heater box triggered immediately and consistently when pressure was relieved from sitting solidly on a flat surface.  It is uncomplicated to operate – you turn it on, set the dial for desired temperature level, and enjoy.  The space heater puts out a level of warmth like two other similar size space heaters that we own and did not over-heat the floor directly in front of it.  As a caution – the front grill gets very hot when the heater is operating (as our two other different brands of space heaters do). We would not use any space heater in the vicinity of small children or pets without constant supervision.  It took the chill off our large family room and would also be perfectly suited for a smaller room or office by adjusting the temperature level down on the dial.

Bought it mainly because it's one of the few not made primarily of plastic.  Although the instruction manual did advise to run it on high for 2 hours outside or in a well ventilated area the first time to burn off any plastic residue so there must be some inside there somewhere.  It really kicks out the heat. And despite what the description says it actually doesn't get that hot to the touch.  I didn't even bother putting the handle on and have no issues with moving it around during use if I need to.  The caveats you should know about are these:  First, it doesn't have automatic temperature control, meaning you set it to a certain temp and it turns itself off/on to maintain that room temperature. When you put it on it stays on.  Where this gives me trouble is if I have it on too high overnight it gets too hot in the room to the point it wakes me up. So on a cold night you set it to be toasty when you are going to sleep but by the time it's 2am you wake up roasting. Have to be mindful to not set it too high if just using it to heat your bedroom.  The second caveat is it is really not that quiet. The fan runs louder than the last space heater I had, and if you are planning to use it in a room where you are watching tv, know that you'll need to crank up the tv volume a bit as the fan on this thing can be a bit overpowering.

Try as I might, my heater in the other room just wouldn't heat up my bedroom too. I didn't get to have anybody scheduled to come fix the heater until mid-February (6 weeks after the heater stopped), and I wasn't willing to sit in the cold.In came this little beastie!! For reference, my bedroom is roughly 12x13 ft and this little heater gets the room cozy. If you close the door and turn the heat up, you can get a really solid heat going on. If you just want some casual, cozy, I'm-pretending-I-have-a-fireplace vibes, turn the temperature knob down and enjoy the warmth in your little corner. Don't sit too close to it, because it can pack a punch.There's a little button/lever on the bottom of the heater that depresses when it's on the floor. If you pick up or move the heater and that button releases, the heater automatically turns off.

Try as I might, my heater in the other room just wouldn't heat up my bedroom too. I didn't get to have anybody scheduled to come fix the heater until mid-February (6 weeks after the heater stopped), and I wasn't willing to sit in the cold.In came this little beastie!! For reference, my bedroom is roughly 12x13 ft and this little heater gets the room cozy. If you close the door and turn the heat up, you can get a really solid heat going on. If you just want some casual, cozy, I'm-pretending-I-have-a-fireplace vibes, turn the temperature knob down and enjoy the warmth in your little corner. Don't sit too close to it, because it can pack a punch.There's a little button/lever on the bottom of the heater that depresses when it's on the floor. If you pick up or move the heater and that button releases, the heater automatically turns off. If you're worried about it tipping over, it's very stable, but rest assured that it does turn off immediately. The handle on top is also easy to hold and has never been hot to touch for me.Bonus: I bought the green version and it almost perfectly matches the color of my desk. Very cute!"

I simply move my iSiLER heater out to my front office room area, turn it on and in 20 minutes it goes from 55 degrees to 75 degrees in the entire room.I like the quality construction, the handle on top, the solid one-piece cabinet construction and stability and the heating element, which is controlled by an easy-to-get-used-to thermostat dial on the back.I’ve purchased heaters over the decades, including in the 1970’s when they were customized toaster ovens!I love my iSiLER space heater, and I know you will too. I hope this helps you choose after I did all the work!But that’s how I chose it too, thanks to others reviews.Sincerely,Scott Kennedy"

I'd had this on my wishlist for a while and when it was being phased out for $25 I snatched one and am completely satisfied. You will have to assemble the handle and base mount using a screwdriver, but unless you're completely uncoordinated, you should be able to pull it off. The metal housing definitely heats up (hence the plastic handle), but the cutoff switch should keep it from bursting into flames.

I'd had this on my wishlist for a while and when it was being phased out for $25 I snatched one and am completely satisfied. You will have to assemble the handle and base mount using a screwdriver, but unless you're completely uncoordinated, you should be able to pull it off. The metal housing definitely heats up (hence the plastic handle), but the cutoff switch should keep it from bursting into flames.

The only down side is that the outside of the heater gets hot so it would not be good if you have little kids around. It does have an emergency off if it tilts or is lifted by the handle of which is a nice safety feature. It is compact enough to bring on vacation or for a camper.

I have a small room, 8x10, I wanted to try this in as it is always cold in there.  I set it on the floor and let it run.  Warm air was coming out and things seemed off to a good start.  I came back in 10 minutes and the fan was blowing cold air and the room was still just as cold.  Apparently this is one of the features, that the fan blows whether the heater is on or not.  I wasn't even considering that, mainly wondering why it had stopped heating.  The thermostat dial was on highest level, but it was definitely still cold in the room.  I turned it off and on, and it started blowing warm air again.  I came back in 2 minutes to the same result.Ultimately I'm not sure whats going on, but know these things have a feature that disables the heater temporarily if it gets too hot, blowing regular air until it cools a bit.  The problem for me was that it seems to be kicking in well before any usefulness of the heater is even achieved!  Sometimes turning on/off helps, other times it stays cold air.  I can't even say its defective, as it will blow warm air again at some point.Feature or not, that experience was a deal breaker for me.

I have a small room, 8x10, I wanted to try this in as it is always cold in there.  I set it on the floor and let it run.  Warm air was coming out and things seemed off to a good start.  I came back in 10 minutes and the fan was blowing cold air and the room was still just as cold.  Apparently this is one of the features, that the fan blows whether the heater is on or not.  I wasn't even considering that, mainly wondering why it had stopped heating.  The thermostat dial was on highest level, but it was definitely still cold in the room.  I turned it off and on, and it started blowing warm air again.  I came back in 2 minutes to the same result.Ultimately I'm not sure whats going on, but know these things have a feature that disables the heater temporarily if it gets too hot, blowing regular air until it cools a bit.  The problem for me was that it seems to be kicking in well before any usefulness of the heater is even achieved!  Sometimes turning on/off helps, other times it stays cold air.  I can't even say its defective, as it will blow warm air again at some point.Feature or not, that experience was a deal breaker for me.  This thing might be good under a desk to warm your feet for 30 seconds, but it is useless as a heater expected to blow warm air with any consistency."

So I may grab another one for myself hah. It doesn't burn, or pump out 200 degree heat, which is a huge plus for me. While it doesn't flamethrow magma levels of heat and burn you, it's very solid to keep you at a perfect comfy warm level of warm. Huge plus for me, again as i'm normally always burning up even when cold. Safety features are standard and nice, in case it does knock over you won't burn your home down, and the look of it is very nice.

The power cord is about 3 feet, so you may need to get an extension chord.

It’s compact, lightweight, and super easy to move from room to room. I love using it in my living room, especially on hardwood floors, where my feet tend to get cold.

The ceramic heating element has two intensity levels—high and low—which affect how much heat it emits. This makes it really versatile because you can fine-tune the warmth to your preference rather than being stuck with only preset options.The oscillation feature is another big plus! Instead of just heating one spot, it moves back and forth to spread warmth evenly across the room. It even has a fan-only mode, which is great for air circulation when heat isn’t needed.The only small downside is that it dries out the air, so if I leave it on overnight, I sometimes wake up with a dry throat. But that’s pretty common with space heaters and can be fixed with a humidifier.Overall, it’s a fantastic heater for small rooms, offices, or just warming up your feet while relaxing!

But they heat up much more quickly than the others.Although these heaters have temperature sensors which shut them down if they get too hot inside, it's still a good idea to keep their heating elements clean to get the best performance. There might be some trick to cleaning them without opening the heater, such as hitting them with a powerful blast of compressed air from the front. I couldn't find anything about this on the internet. The standard advice is to leave cleaning up to experts, but I've dismantled my heaters many times  to get at the back of their heating elements and vacuum them, and haven't had any serious problems. I tried using a shop vac with a cut-off funnel as a nozzle to pull air backwards through the heater, but this didn't get the heating element clean.It might be sufficient to open the heater up and blast the front of the heating element with canned compressed air, but the only way to know that it's clean is to remove it and examine the back. Removing the element involves prying some plastic pieces outward and prying the element out, all at the same time. Just be careful to avoid touching the front or back of the element with anything hard, because the element is made of soft metal which bends easily, and this can create obstructions to airflow.I'd set the heater on a soft cushion so that it can sink in and remain stable, and to be safe, you should wear safety glasses in case a plastic piece breaks off and goes flying at your eye, although the plastic used for my Amazon Basics units isn't very brittle and doesn't seem like it will break off.Another option (which I've been meaning to try, but haven't gotten around to it) would be to put something like a True Blue electrostatic filter on the back, and vacuum or wash the filter periodically. The advantage of an electrostatic filter is that it contains a permanent ionic charge which traps dust although the filter allows air to pass relatively easily, assuming that it's not too clogged.At first, I had some difficulty reassembling these heaters after vacuuming them, but after opening them and reassembling them a few times, it became easier.

I don't know if I got a defective one or if it's just that loud. It's not vibrating or the fan is not rubbing on anything. It's just not well designed for being quiet. I really like the oscillation function. It's just a switch to turn it on or off. And I love that these are not touch sensitive buttons but they're actually physical dials for the fan speed and the temperature setting. That way you can put it on a smart plug to just turn it on or off whenever you want without even getting up. Much better than a smart heater which will probably not work in a few years and probably has an app that's just stealing your data haha! I bought this heater to use in my hobby room so being a little loud is not a huge deal. And it does distribute the heat well.

Fall has just started but it is a most wicked cold that sets into your bones. My brother-in-law's house heater is broken right now so we just have to grin and bear it. 6 of us live here so we're just a pile of blankets right now until the repairman can get over here. I have little patience for feeling cold, I just downright hate it. Cold has always been worse for me it seems than for others as cold actually feels painful to me. My fingers get stiff, slow and curl a little depending on how cold it is and my thighs tend to burn. If someone can't provide the heat for me I will go solve the problem myself.I researched heaters found on Amazon for 2 or 3 weeks looking at not only star ratings but user reviews. This one looked pretty good to me but to be honest it wasn't the forerunner in my heater quest. The Lasko ""My Heat Personal Ceramic Heater"" was actually my first choice but after some mixed reviews and some people calling it junk I passed on it. I had it in the cart ready to go I just couldn't reconcile myself to all the reviews that said it stopped working. It's compact size had me eyeing it also over this one but ultimately I chose this ceramic heater and I am very glad I did.This heater is by no means giant but it is bigger than what I would have hoped for. I honestly only wanted something about the size of a coffee mug but that's a little unrealistic and anything that is that small seems to have reviews of it breaking or making strange noises, I liken it to a chihuahua...shakes,sputters and isn't too stable (falls over fairly easy) due to small size (sorry chihuahua lovers). The dimensions of this heater are 8.5 inches tall X 5.5 inches wide X 6 inches across the top. It's not too big as you can see. The heater does a really good job in the morning of warming us up in the short time between waking up and rushing to get ready for work. In about 10 minutes a frosty room is a pleasantly warm room (we use low setting otherwise the room would be boiling hot in that short time span). I keep the heater elevated on a dresser top at the foot of the bed but pointing towards us and I can actually feel the hot air blowing on me from that far away, I love it!The heater has 2 knobs on the top of it. The first knob for adjusting  0 (on,off) , fan (for cold air), 1(low heat) and 2 (high heat output) and the other knob is your heat/temp control, on the bottom of the knob is a power icon. I haven't exactly figured out WHY the first knob has a little power symbol on it it's not like the knob can actually turn to it and shut off so it appears as if the symbol is there just to take up space. Located between the two knobs is a little oval red light. It is always turned on so long as the heater is plugged in, it never shuts off. As I write this I am in bed, in my fuzzy pajamas with the heat blowing on me...I know I should get up and start my day but the envelope of warm goodness around me is too good to give up - this heater is a dangerous thing when I want to stay in bed with it blowing on me lol.We paid 20 bucks for it , I can't complain about that at all. Amazon has other heaters selling for insane amounts that don't have half of the rating this little thing does. I am pleased and happy all around with the purchase. A man that HATES any sort of warmth doesn't mind this thing and actually welcomes it in the morning, that says a lot considering it's been a 4 year battle with my man to get some heat in the colder months. He likes it about 50 to 60 inside the house (when we had our own) and I adore 75 - 80 weather. Quite a difference there in what each of us thinks is comfortable temp. I pick on him and just tell him not everyone was born in Siberia (he literally was born in Siberia). So over all I give this thing a 5 star rating based on the almost week we've had it. Here is a quick review of the good, the bad and the ugly of it all...The Good :-Small-Nice silver color-Amazing job warming us and the room up-No typical heater odors other than the ""used for the first time"" smell you get when any heating element is warmed for the first time-Great price-Sturdy construction-Easy to understand controls-Can provide you with either warm or cool air-Auto temp gauge to shut off when the room is the desired temp-Overheating protection (although I've never had to test it, it's never overheated on me)Decent length cord (it's not the longest but it is longer than most we've had through the years)-Red light always reminds you it's plugged in-casing stays cool to the touch (but the grill gets hot)-Has a little mini handle (good only for VERY small hands)The bad and ugly:-can't figure out why one of the knobs has a power icon when you can't shut it off so that the red light goes out-would be nice if it had tip over protection (although it's pretty stable but there is no accounting for animals or kids that may knock it over)-The handle is not the best it could slip right out of my fingertips since that is all that really gets in there is the tips of my fingersOverall I am very happy.

It has an automatic 'overheat' kill switch, shutting the appliance off if it begins to overheat (but I've not experienced that to date). While the instructions caution one about the ceramic exterior getting hot, I have not experienced that even though I've been watching (and feeling) for it.  This unit measures 8.5"" high, 6"" wide and 4.5"" in depth (smaller than 2 boxes of tissues stacked upright)and is pleasing to the eye. Easy to use, one can turn it on and set it to run as long as desired, or use the thermostat setting for it to come on/turn off as the area warms to your settings. Easy to set the thermostat function: turn unit on full blast until the room/area warms to your satisfaction, then slowly turn the thermostat dial down until the unit stops running. After that, it will turn on/off as the room cools/warms per your setting. To reset to a different therm. setting, simply let unit cool completely (unplug for about 10 minutes) and you can reset as before. A small, unobtrusive red 'on' light peeks at you from the center front top of the unit so one always knows it is plugged in. They require a 120 outlet and instructions caution NOT to use surge suppresors, power strips or extension cords for its operation.I've used these in the cellar while I'm doing laundry/ironing (unfinished cellar is cold and damp in the winter months), and aside from keeping me from getting chilled, I've noticed it helps to dry the clothes on the cellar lines & drying racks also.It is intended for use on the floor, not on furniture. This may be an issue for those with young children or pets, but it is easily placed behind an open bottomed chair, area table with legs, beneath a coffee table, etc. Right now, one is beneath my kitchen table with the chairs in front of it as the 6 dogs go in/out the back door all day/night long. I no longer have to walk into a freezing kitchen because I've had to open the back door so often. This little powerhouse of a unit kicks on as soon as the cold air hits the floor and runs until the kitchen is warm again and it is only on the 2nd setting! There are 9 higher settings from which to choose. While it isn't completely silent in operation, it isn't loud either. A normal hum similar to a small fan on very low setting. My stove hood fan on ""low""  makes more noise than this unit as does a kettle of water almost reaching its boiling point.I like these so much, I'm back for a few more for my sister. Her 3rd floor apartment is in a historically-old multi-family dwelling with poor insulation. She is always cold, always catching colds and her heating bills are astronomical trying to keep the apartment warm. I think she's going to love these as well as I do as she can move them to any room she is in at the time without having to raise the heat in the entire apartment.Can't go wrong with these, esp. this price!Edit: Super Bowl Sunday, 2/7/10 - wanted to see if one of these would warm the entranceway as hubby's guests come in/out during the game today as we leave the beverages outside stuffed in the snow to keep them really, really cold. I didn't use an extension cord, but for the area I wanted to place the heater, I did try a surge suppressor. Several times.

This is the only place I feel that it's safe to run it 24x7.A few brands have died in the dust but most have lasted over ten years. I'll explain the reasons for their long lifespan later.For the money, safety, ease of necessary alterations and cleaning, the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater is my go-to guy.  Amazon.com touts this heater as their #1 Best Seller.Running several space heaters in a home can sometimes get frustrating if two are set on 1500 watts and happen to be on the same circuit. When the circuit breaker trips, everybody freezes. The same thing happens in conjunction with any 1500 watt appliance like a hair dryer or microwave.The first thing I would suggest is to learn exactly what outlets in your dwelling are on the same breaker.  I've clearly labeled our circuits in the breaker box in black ink.I'm not a heating and air specialist. However, I'm pretty good at knowing when a room is comfortable. I'd rather have two of these heaters running on low (900 watts) watts with thermostats set at 75% on opposite sides of a room than one heater burning 1500 watts in the middle set on high.  It just isn't safe to run any space heater at max unless you stay with in.  Most folks have to walk away every now and then.Now, it's vent time, pun intended.The biggest problem I've had with space heaters over the years is that most do not have filters. Amazon's #1 seller (I currently have 3 in use) does not have a filter. Any dust, lint, hair or whatever that's floating in the air is sucked in from the back. Most of it burns up and turns to ash and is emitted back out into the room for allergy sufferers to breathe and choke on. Some of it collects inside the unit, especially on ceramic disc style heaters.The very first thing I do with these non-filtered space heaters is to add a filter. It's very simple. And the Lasko is the easiest of any I've done.  The contoured box shape is conducive for this addition and makes the filter less visible.Attach strips of adhesive (male) Velcro to the back of the frame around the air intake. Carbon-treated filter material is widely available. I use so much of it that I buy it buy the bulk roll. This stuff adheres to male Velcro just like female Velcro.I cut a section of carbon pre-filter that fits and stick it on. Granted, it's not the most attractive thing in the world but it works. Every couple of days, I lightly run a vacuum hose over the filter. Do not try this with a roller brush. GLUP! Your filter is gone.Every month, I replace the filter. Just peel off the old and stick on the new. Every space heater in our home serves a dual purpose of both heater and air filter.Most of my space heaters are over ten years old and run as good as new.Charred debris and pollution building up inside space heaters is the number one cause of failure and fires, especially if they are run on high, causing the cost of operation to soar and the efficiency to plummet.If you have an old ceramic heater that's seems to be getting weak, ""carefully"" blow it out with a low-pressure air hose or a can of compressed air in the sunlight. You'll be shocked at the dust that comes out. If you try this with a high-pressure air hose, you might need to go shopping for a new heater.Warm air is nice in winter.

Add wind, and it gets freaky cold inside! We've actually hadice on the closet walls before.So, I wanted to get a small space heater that wouldn't require us running the central heatif only our bedroom was cold.This little guy does the job very well.I don't find the noise annoying - it is like a computer running, with slight magnification.It is not as noisy as a fan. I don't mind it a bit, and it can be like white noise, blockingout other small annoyances.This is so completely adjustable, it makes it great.I've used both the high and low power settings, and don't see a huge difference between them.I guess the high technically heats up faster, but again, I didn't really notice.The other dial is how warm you want the air to be that comes out.I've used it on many of the settings so far. Yesterday, for example, had 30-40 mph winds hereand it was very cold in the bedroom - cold enough I had a hard time sewing something by hand!I put the little heater aimed at my desk, and within 1/2 hr, the room was very comfortable.The room is about 12' x 10'.  By the time my daughter got home from school, it was too hot,and we had to turn it off for a while!All in all, I'm very happy with it. We bought two different kinds, one for downstairs and onefor upstairs, to try to cut back on our utility bill. The other brand works just fine too, butI think this one is a little better! : )All in all, I would definitely recommend it. It won't heat a 2-story house, but it does 2 or 3 roomsto a pleasant temperature (I don't like it super hot anyway, but it gets to 72 pretty easily) very well.Upstairs, we have two bedrooms and a small bathroom. I can put this in the hallway, and, although ittakes a little longer, will have the upstairs comfortably warm in an hour or so. The bedroom alonewith the heater in the room takes much less time. I've even had it near the desk when my handswere freezing while typing!Not sure how great the fan alone will be - I'll try that when it gets stuffy some day.But I bought it for heating, and it does exactly what it says, and does it well.Very pleased with the purchase.=============================================================UPDATE:Well, we had our first problem with the heater today!We have used it probably ten times this winter, and it has done a wonderful job of warmingthe bedroom/hall area. HOWEVER - today, March 29, we went to unplug the heater and box itback up for next winter's use. This is where the problem began!I tried to unplug the heater, and couldn't do it! I tried and failed, tried the other hand and failed.When my son got home, had HIM try and he failed!  It took the two of us to get the heater disconnectedfrom the plug, and when we finally did, the prongs came out of the plug!! OMG.Well, THAT was an interesting development!I checked on the website, and the heater has a one-year warranty on parts. So, I contactedLasko via their customer care center, and we'll see what they will do about it!I could hardly believe it! We've had it plugged in since December, so around three months,but I really don't think that's long enough to create a stuck plug problem!I'll update about how Lasko customer service is once I hear back, and we find a resolution to the problem.Until then - unplug carefully! You can see the glue on the end of the plug on ours!UPDATE:No response from Lasko yet, so it is looking like I'll be buying another brandof small space heater for next winter. What a shame.

That room has no heat at all in it. I spend a lot of time on my computer and in the winter I just about freeze to death down there. I did research here on Amazon and read many reviews before deciding on this one. I really liked the idea that it was thermostat controlled. I put the heater next to my computer desk on the floor and set it to #1 and then turned up the other knob until the heat started running. This heater put out a lot of heat, even on the 1 setting, and my feet began to feel hot. So I got a small step stool I had and put it on that to see if the heat would cover the rest of my body better. This was a big improvement because then my whole body was warm. In fact, it warmed me so well that I had to push the heater further away from me and not point it directly on me because it did get a little too warm after awhile. My computer room is a rather large room, at least 16X24, so the room does not get toasty warm with this heater. But it does take off the chill of the room and makes it comfortable.I have never had to use the #2 setting on this heater and from what I understand from reading here, the lower the number that you use, the less electricity that you use.I liked this heater so well I decided to buy another one for a large bathroom that we have--the bathroom is as big as a very small bedroom. I take showers and this bathroom is the only one that has a shower stall in it, but during the winter it feels so cold in there after you get out of the shower. So I ordered another one. Evidently the second heater I ordered did not come from the same seller and later I found out it was a refurbished heater. That would explain why this 2nd heater did not run well. Not only did it not push out the heat, it made a terrible noise. I told my husband that something was wrong with the heater and had him to compare the 2 heaters side by side and even he could tell the difference in how much the heaters put out. I call Amazon and told them the problem. I sent it back to Amazon, free shipping back, and re-ordered another one of these heaters. It was when I decided to send the 2nd heater back that I discovered it was a refurbished heater--and the price for the refurbished heater was a higher price than the  band new heat I bought the first time. There was only about 3 months difference between the times I ordered the first and the second heater so there should not have been that much of a rise in price.The 3rd heater I ordered came and ran just as well as the first one did--and was a cheaper price than the refurbished non working heater I bought the second time.

In the winter, it gets cold while the rest of the office is comfortable. I bought this to heat up the office and as a public display of disdain of our office buildings HVAC people.Pros:- Effective heat. As noted, it heats my 14'x14' corner office to the point that my feet sweat which is my sign to turn it off. Yes, I'm that office sweaty foot guy.- Compact. It sits on my desk. I wouldn't call it stylish and I'm certainly not making it the centerpiece of my desk, but it looks right at home with the other things on my desk.- Value. This looked like the best option in the $25 price range. No regrets.Cons:- Noise. The fan is a little bit on the loud side and it's not adjustable so far as I can tell. Keep in mind that I'm a typical guy - I did not read the small instruction booklet so I could be wrong about its one-speed-fits-all approach, but if the trade off is frozen fingers I'll deal with it. It's not loud enough that it's going to impede a conversation, but it is loud enough that I turn it off when someone comes into my office. To be fair the level of noise seems appropriate given the fan size, but I'm not an expert on fans so don't quote me on that.- Smell. For the first several days of use, it gives off that funny ""new heating appliance smell"" that's almost like chemical burning. I can't describe it any other way except that my new toaster had the same problem. Given my toaster is touching food and this thing isn't, I'm not too concerned, but it's not pleasant. After a week of consistent use, the smell is still present, but very muted compared to when it was brand new. I have to try and notice it to notice it at this point.- Thermostat efficacy. The thermostat works. I do find that the same setting gives me different levels of heat based on environmental temperatures, but hey, at $25 I'm not expecting a WiFi-enabled smart heater that can carry payloads to the International Space Station.- Vibration. The narrow rails on the bottom of the device that contact the surface of whatever it's resting on are not soft. When the unit is on it vibrates and this is noticeable on a hard surface.

In the winter, it gets cold while the rest of the office is comfortable. I bought this to heat up the office and as a public display of disdain of our office buildings HVAC people.Pros:- Effective heat. As noted, it heats my 14'x14' corner office to the point that my feet sweat which is my sign to turn it off. Yes, I'm that office sweaty foot guy.- Compact. It sits on my desk. I wouldn't call it stylish and I'm certainly not making it the centerpiece of my desk, but it looks right at home with the other things on my desk.- Value. This looked like the best option in the $25 price range. No regrets.Cons:- Noise. The fan is a little bit on the loud side and it's not adjustable so far as I can tell. Keep in mind that I'm a typical guy - I did not read the small instruction booklet so I could be wrong about its one-speed-fits-all approach, but if the trade off is frozen fingers I'll deal with it. It's not loud enough that it's going to impede a conversation, but it is loud enough that I turn it off when someone comes into my office. To be fair the level of noise seems appropriate given the fan size, but I'm not an expert on fans so don't quote me on that.- Smell. For the first several days of use, it gives off that funny ""new heating appliance smell"" that's almost like chemical burning. I can't describe it any other way except that my new toaster had the same problem. Given my toaster is touching food and this thing isn't, I'm not too concerned, but it's not pleasant. After a week of consistent use, the smell is still present, but very muted compared to when it was brand new. I have to try and notice it to notice it at this point.- Thermostat efficacy. The thermostat works. I do find that the same setting gives me different levels of heat based on environmental temperatures, but hey, at $25 I'm not expecting a WiFi-enabled smart heater that can carry payloads to the International Space Station.- Vibration. The narrow rails on the bottom of the device that contact the surface of whatever it's resting on are not soft. When the unit is on it vibrates and this is noticeable on a hard surface. Easily solved with something soft (I used folded paper) underneath it. The folded paper I put under it isn't visible, so no aesthetic issues.

So far, it's worked pretty well, and I would recommend it as an inexpensive solution for small spaces. I'd give it more like 3.5 stars if I could, given that it's only good in certain situations.  Here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Heats up quickly, pretty much as soon as you turn it on.- Temperature gauge setting allows you to adjust level of heat.- Cord is several feet long and allows for easy placement.- Shallow grip on the back makes it easy to move.- It's compact and easy to store.Cons:- It doesn't produce a whole lot of heat, even on the highest setting, so it's best to keep it close to you and for use in very small spaces. (I keep it under my desk pointed at my legs in my drafty office and it does the trick).- It isn't noisy, but it does produce a little bit of sound.  Nothing you can't tune out easily in an office setting, but if you're using it in the bedroom for sleeping, it might be a little distracting if you're a light sleeper. It's about the level of white noise you'd expect for a small space heater, so nothing to worry about.- Not sure if it has a safety setting if it gets knocked over (my old one automatically shut off if it went on its side.

This might be a deal-breaker for you if you have small kids or pets.- Doesn't seem to be much of a difference in fan speed/strength between the ""1"" and ""2"" setting.Other Notes:- Don't plug this into a power strip -- it will max it out.  Make sure you plug directly into a wall outlet.- It seems to be made of decent quality hard plastic.- The other reviewers mentioned a plastic smell upon the first few days of operation, which concerned me a little.

BUT if you have small children around, you might want to keep it elevated or at least blocked off, because the heat itself can get extremely high, and feel like it is burning your skin right off, if you have it on high enough.Otherwise, enjoy and stay warm, my friends!If my review has helped you in any way, please let me know, or hit ""Yes"" under this review. Thank you! :)"

It ships in a generic brown box, and taped up.  So i thought it might be a refurb,  it actually could be, but it doesn't look like one after i pulled it out, the plastic and everything looked new.  I turned it on and am testing it now for a few hours as it gets cold at night now.  The fan noise is noticeable, but it's not loud like people say,  like i have it in my room with the tv on and it doesn't bother me.  So far i have it set to middle temp and to fan speed 1,  guess i never hit the temp yet as it hasn't turned off at all yet.  it's been going at the same rate for over an hour.

It has held up fine with a great deal of use in the wintertime months. I keep it on the low power setting to heat the small bedroom I sleep in. I'll also take it in the bathroom sometimes and that is the only time I use the high power setting on the heater. I also use it as my main heater while I watch TV. On a cold night I put the heater pretty close to me while watching TV. Due to the heaters small size it does not do that well heating up the large living room that my TV is in. It performs better in my bedroom.This Lasko heater gets high marks for portability. This is the only smaller sized heater I own. I do wish I had a couple more of these heaters as in the winter time I am constantly unplugging the unit. I do have a couple larger oil filled metal finned heaters and they are a real chore to move around the home.The thermostat on the unit could be a bit more sensitive. Sometimes if seems a bit difficult to dial in an exact temperature setting on the dial.This heater gets excellent marks for reliability for the three years I've owned it.

It has held up fine with a great deal of use in the wintertime months. I keep it on the low power setting to heat the small bedroom I sleep in. I'll also take it in the bathroom sometimes and that is the only time I use the high power setting on the heater. I also use it as my main heater while I watch TV. On a cold night I put the heater pretty close to me while watching TV. Due to the heaters small size it does not do that well heating up the large living room that my TV is in. It performs better in my bedroom.This Lasko heater gets high marks for portability. This is the only smaller sized heater I own. I do wish I had a couple more of these heaters as in the winter time I am constantly unplugging the unit. I do have a couple larger oil filled metal finned heaters and they are a real chore to move around the home.The thermostat on the unit could be a bit more sensitive. Sometimes if seems a bit difficult to dial in an exact temperature setting on the dial.This heater gets excellent marks for reliability for the three years I've owned it. All to often these small inexpensive heaters do not last very long which is my main complaint. This heater is inexpensive and at the same time is very reliable. I give it a thumbs up as a purchase choice.

While initially happy, I noticed that it was not tripping my circuit breaker when used with other high wattage appliances.  The sum of the rated wattages on all the devices connected to this residential circuit totaled 3000 watts.  This implied a 25 amp current draw that should have easily tripped the 15 amp circuit. The reality was that the Lasko heater consumed far less electricity than the stated 1500 watts.Given this realization, I tested the Lasko 754200 Ceramic Heater under various conditions over multiple periods of time with two different Kill-a-watt power meters. The results were somewhat surprising, indicating half the stated wattage was actually being consumed.Like any electrical heating element, the initial current and wattage will vary during the startup phase. Hence, measurements over a period of time must be made.

It's nice and small, yet still gets my room up to a nice temperature really quick. The temp controls work well too. It has a bit of noise from the fan as you'd expect. I was hoping this could double as a cooling fan during summer, but it's not powerful enough to reach more than a foot or so.But I just couldn't forgive the chemical odor it had. It has a noticeable plastic / chemical smell when you first start it. I heard that sometimes tempering heaters removes the smell, so I put it in a ventilated room and ran it on high for a couple of days. The smell did get better. In fact, it got to the point where I could run it without noticing the smell, unless I left the room. Coming back in, I could smell it. Which wasn't horrible. Unfortunately, even if I couldn't smell it, I still got headaches when using it. It's worth noting it's almost entirely plastic, even the fan blades. But is it the plastic, or maybe the lube for the fan that bothers me? I can't tell. I don't get headaches from it when it's not in use.It was too cheap to be worth trying to send it back (besides which, it's ins't broken, I'm just sensitive to the smell). But I was reluctant to buy something else form Amazon for the same reason. There is a happy ending though. I recently bought a Sai Oil-Filled Radiator 682101 from Home Depot (because I could easily return it if it smelled). This thing is great. It's nearly all metal (except the plastic front pieces). It's completely silent (no fans, the only sound is a slight click when the temp regulator turns on and off). And best of all, no smell! I tempered it for about 6 hours and noticed a really faint smell I couldn't quite place during the process. It's been in my room ever since, and I haven't had any headaches. The only downside is that it doesn't have numbers on it's dial, so it's tricky to figure what will maintain a comfortable temp. So if you're sensitive to chemical smells, like I am, I highly recommend the Sai.Oil-filled Radiators are supposed to be pretty good in general. So if they don't have a Sai, try a different one. Just remember, temper your heater on high, in a well ventilated place, for a couple hours before bringing it inside. Most of them have a chemical film that's supposed to prevent rust while in storage, and that's what smells until it burns off.Also, please note, a radiator is a different beast from a forced air fan entirely. They take a while to heat up a room (an hour or so). And you're better off leaving them on continuously. They also don't dry a room out the way a fan does.

Again, it didn't bother those around me so and I got used to the sound after a few minutes.  It's actually a good reminder for me to not leave it running.The third problem, and this might be the most noticeable to those in a small space is that it seems to really direct the heat in one location.  It doesn't spread out and cover a lot of ground. I'm still struggling to find the right place for it; if I leave it under my desk near my legs it burns my skin, but if I move it too far away I don't feel the heat.  I've settled for keeping it on my desk and letting it blow onto my back.  When making your purchase be sure to keep in mind where you plan on putting the heater.All in all, I like this heater.  It was cheaper than other options and I think it does what it's supposed to - keep you warm!  But do keep in mind that it does have a faint odor and is a little difficult to place."

I worry that if the light's on, maybe the heater's still on even if the fan's off.  So between that and the fact that when it's working, the controls don't seem to actually control the fan or temperature, it would better to just have one on/off toggle that effectively controlled everything including the light.Since the unit can't be used with an extension cord or power strip, a much longer cord would also be helpful.In sum, this unit is turning out to be almost completely useless to me.

I worry that if the light's on, maybe the heater's still on even if the fan's off.  So between that and the fact that when it's working, the controls don't seem to actually control the fan or temperature, it would better to just have one on/off toggle that effectively controlled everything including the light.Since the unit can't be used with an extension cord or power strip, a much longer cord would also be helpful.In sum, this unit is turning out to be almost completely useless to me.

This is the first heater I've ever bought and was suggested to get something like this from a friend to save money on my electric bill. The amount of money I have saved is pretty great. Normally around winter time, using the heater in my apartment would rank up my electric bill to about 120-130 dollars (normally it's like 30-40 during the summer).

This is the first heater I've ever bought and was suggested to get something like this from a friend to save money on my electric bill. The amount of money I have saved is pretty great. Normally around winter time, using the heater in my apartment would rank up my electric bill to about 120-130 dollars (normally it's like 30-40 during the summer). Using this, it dropped the price down to about 70-80 on my bill.As far as heat and usage goes, I'm unsure how reliable this thing is going to be in the long run.
