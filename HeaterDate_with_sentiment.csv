It does not warm a garage per say or a 10 x 10 green house. I did however bring the plants and kenneled farm animals in closer together and made a temporary wall opposite of heater to help them through the low temps in the garage. It was warm enough to sustain them but. Still not as warm as expected. I decided to continue use of heat lamp with it Durning night temps. We had an emergency situation with our animals habitats being destroyed Durning recent storms. We bought this as it was a temporary emergent situation. Next year I will look for a larger option. I plan to try it in the camper and see if it would warm that area of space. It didn't work as planned in greenhouse or garage without improvisions.,-0.6164,0.2462

I’ve had a small black space heater that sits in my office for years - but the cord is short and there’s no where to set it so that I could easily move it between spaces without unplugging it each use or using an extension cord - which I am not sure is safe.  So I got this one designed for wet spaces and in white with a longer cord that would reach the outlet in my teeny bathroom up by the light switches.  I am pleased with the simplicity and instant heat.",0.1149,0

The problem is that most of these small space heaters have small fans that run at higher RPM and produce a significant amount of sound and don't really move much air, so you get noise and it is very warm close to the heater, but still cold only a couple feet away.  In addition, most are not heat selectable, so they draw a large amount of current that can't be adjusted and in the office setting, you may not have enough current to run a 1000W-1500W space heater.  If that happens, then you'll trip the electrical breaker for your office and maybe a few adjoining ones.  Then you'll have the facilities people on your butt for having an unapproved electrical device.I drew the unlucky straw of getting the office at work with the cold air return for HVAC in it, so my office is cold all winter long.  So cold that it's referred to as The Beer Fridge.  Then in the summer, it turns into an oven.In desperation I bought one of the typical inexpensive heaters that drew 1250W and put it under my desk.  It was very warm under my desk, but took a very long time to make the office comfortable.  In addition, one cooler morning a coworker in the next office turned on a space heater also and it popped the breaker for 4 offices.  We were not very popular as the Facilities person was in a different building that morning and it took a couple hours until we had power in our offices again.So, time to look for a better space heater that had an adjustable heat setting and would move air better.  Something that was more fan than toaster oven. That is what the Vornado VH202 is.  It really moves a much larger quantity of air and it is quiet.  It is more a fan with a heating element than a space heater.  It is selectable for 375W or 750W, so I can avoid run-ins with Facilities and warms the whole office up instead of just creating a hot-spot under my desk.  As and added bonus, you can also run it in fan-only mode for those warmer days.The only thing missing in this model is a thermostat that some space heaters have.  Not a big thing for me as I never leave it running when not in my office, but if that feature is important to you, then look at some of Vornado's higher-end models.

It’s so warm I can usually heat the space in a few minutes - especially if I’m moving around.The design is modern and streamlined - looks great in my house… The housing stays cool so if you touch the sides, top, bottom, you don’t get burned. The automatic cut-off works well - stops if it is tipped or knocked over.This heater is a great value. I highly recommend it!!",0.9798,0.5719

I like to crack a window in the window for fresh air and we keep his fur short so I want him to be comfortable with warm. Even with blankets I want him to stay cozy, and feel that if he needs to warm up he can. I grabbed this lil guy for my pupper and it's perfect. It's slightly bigger than two iphones put together and outputs enough heat to just keep you very comfy. When he was walking around I sat in front of it and was actually quite impressed. So I may grab another one for myself hah. It doesn't burn, or pump out 200 degree heat, which is a huge plus for me. While it doesn't flamethrow magma levels of heat and burn you, it's very solid to keep you at a perfect comfy warm level of warm. Huge plus for me, again as i'm normally always burning up even when cold. Safety features are standard and nice, in case it does knock over you won't burn your home down, and the look of it is very nice. I got the blue color and the gold hardware on the blue heater looks very upscaled and classy. I could easily see this on an office desk, or at your feet as way to keep your toes warm. The power cord is about 3 feet, so you may need to get an extension chord. It also has a cool setting that blows a bit of cold air at you which might be nice to use as a way to dry a painting, or your nails, which i'll eventually try.
