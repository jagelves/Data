26-May-25,5,35,Powerful little fan.,This is the 2nd time I’ve purchased this fan. First one lasted probably over 10 years before it finally wore out. Has great air flow and runs quietly. It’s small and doesn’t take up much space. I use it in the bathroom while I’m drying my hair and getting dressed. Also take it with us when we travel because I like a fan blowing over me while I sleep. And I like the white noise.,0.919
23-May-25,1,35,Very loud,Very loud whine.,-0.4173
22-May-25,1,35,Bad product vibrates when on.,I actually purchased two of these only (replacement) because the first one would vibrate when it was on and now the second one vibrates when it’s on. We only purchased it because we had to replace the one we had which never vibrated and unfortunately stopped working after 2 yrs. This is an extremely bad lot!  I would like to know if I can get this replaced and if we know if you’re using bad  parts possibly that causes a vibration. It’s very annoying!,-0.8494
13-May-25,4,35,works well for its size,"What makes this fan perfect for me is that it is small and narrow.  I have a tiny kitchen with very little counter space and this fan fits perfect between my sink and microwave.  I wouldn't say it's crazy powerful, but it definitely moves the air enough to make a difference.  For as much as this fan is great though, it doesn't seem to last.  I have had to buy a new one every year because it starts making this grinding noise when oscillating after a while.  So the cost definitely adds up for me.  Still.  I can't argue with it's size and function and haven't been able to find anything that works remotely as well that is this small.",0.9842
17-Apr-25,5,35,BUY IT!! YOU WON’T REGRET IT!!,Best desk top fan ever!! Stronger than a large stand up fan!,0.9198
26-Mar-25,2,35,Good but rattling,"It has good airflow and is super slim compared to others however, there is an annoying somewhat high-pitched rattle sound on both modes but it is especially present on the quiet mode making it unbearable for me to have it on while working. I will be returning this unfortunately.",-0.2675
22-Mar-25,1,35,Loud desk ornament,Just received it and I'm already going to return it tomorrow. Very loud and I can't even feel it 4 feet away,0
7-Mar-25,3,35,Loud Vibrating Noise,"Fan works well. Has only two speeds. But, just recently it has started to make a loud vibrating noise. Sounds like it is coming from the motor. Wish I could return to get a replacement, but the window has closed.  It is too loud for an office setting.",0.8402
20-Jan-25,3,35,Very loud clicking sound,This fan sounds like it’s about to break down at any second. It’s like a clicking and grinding sound. I bought it because I had one identical to it for years and figured it would be the same. No. This one looks the same but sounds terrible and doesn’t run the same. The light is very bright so if you use it at night it will illuminate your room. I put bandaids over it to keep it dim.,0.5089
9-Jan-25,5,35,Good,Good delivery,0.4404

6-Nov-24,5,35,GREAT PRODUCT,"Bought 2 of these in 2011.  One for the office and one next to my easy chair, both get used everyday.  The one in the office finally quit (bearing failure) but the other one is still going!  I ordered 2 more because I am anticipating the other 13 yr old to give out sometime.",-0.126
2-Nov-24,5,35,Cool,Love my personal fan. I keep it by my bed. It keeps my cool. My husband is cold natured so it doesn't bother him since it only blows on me.,0.8779
6-Oct-24,4,35,Noisy,Perfect size but wish it was quieter. It’s as loud as a large oscillating fan unfortunately,0.6956
30-Sep-24,1,35,It’s “quiet”…compared to a full sized box fan on high,"I had high hopes for this fan. My sister had purchased an older version of this fan and it was much quieter than this one. I have a 15” Vornado running in the next room over that is less than half the volume of this desktop fan. As a matter of fact, the Vornado runs so silently you have to actually be standing next to it to hear it (when running on low setting). The high setting on this desktop fan is quieter than the low setting, if you can believe it. I would imagine it would be much quieter if good bearings were used (rattles in both high and low modes) and if they ducted the fan properly (high-pitched sound the fan makes along with the rattling). Also, the buttons almost require two hands to press. They’re so cheap they require pressing harder than expected and with the fan weighing so little, pressing the switches moves the fan. Have to either grip the entire fan front to back or use one hand to steady the fan while pressing the buttons with the other. The buttons feel like they have reached the end of their life (you know, like you’ve pressed it so many times the “throw” of the switch or distance it pushes in is nearly nonexistent. It would have been better if they had used touch-sensitive switches since the fan is so lightweight.Manufacturer, spend a little more money on quality parts to build your product and raise the price a little to compensate but give us a product we don’t mind telling others about.So sad.",0.9035
9-Sep-24,5,35,Always buy Lasko,"I have another Lasko fan that has been running non stop in my room for 7 years, all day, every day. These aren't cheap throw away fans, you will likely pass these down for 17 generations with your grandmother's fine china and your fathers watch. I don't do other brands, it's Lasko for me",0.2263
4-Sep-24,2,35,"Worked great 1st few times, now it's super loud","I bought this for my office and have used it maybe a half dozen times. I turned it on today and it was so loud! I haven't dropped it or banged anything into it. It sits on top of a cabinet I rarely use. I turned it off and back on, I tried to wiggle it to see if something came loose inside. There is no reasonable explanation as to why it randomly started rattling like something came loose. It happens on oscillate, still, high, and low speed.",-0.5983
31-Aug-24,5,35,Continued great,Ordered this fan a few years ago for my classroom desk. This time I ordered it for the rv bedroom. Still great-quiet and dependable.,0.3182
27-Aug-24,3,35,"Not for bedroom, too loud and cannot turn off light","We used to have one of these in the bathroom and we liked it there, compact, blows okay, buzzy fan is great to mask other noises. Few years later we thought we’d order another one since we needed a little airflow in the bedroom while sleeping, not good for that. Forgot how loud this thing is. Also, the bright blue led light for the power and rotate button never turns off. Too bright for bedroom.",0.9259
26-Aug-24,2,35,Major flaw,Doesn't work as a fan unless the temperature setting is higher than the room temperature.,0.3182
21-Aug-24,5,35,Favorite fan,"Bought this to replace my bedside table fan, and it's actually quieter. It oscillates and has two settings. Will be buying two more for our camper",0.3182
15-Aug-24,5,35,Great Fan!,"This is actually my second purchase of the same fan. My AC crapped out several weeks ago... of course, in the heat of the summer! This second fan is helping until I get my new AC. They are both awesome because they don't take up a lot of room, and I can kinda fit them into my decor.",0.9081
12-Aug-24,5,35,Great little fan highly recommend it,This is great for across the room or in your bedroom to keep you cooler at night and also great for white noise.,0.8481
9-Aug-24,4,35,Good desk fan,This desk fan works good. It keeps me cool when I'm gaming. The only bad side is that it makes noise when running.,0.4588

7-Jul-24,2,35,Slow Delivery & Loud Operation,"Was not what I was expecting. This thing gives off a motor noise when in use, and isn't quiet enough for the office. The hum is loud enough that I won't use it in my private office in fear that others will come asking about the noise. Shipping was very slow as it came direct. This is overpriced and cheaply made. Would not recommend.",-0.6497
3-Jul-24,5,35,The perfect bedroom fan,"This is a great fan! It's quiet even on high speed, swivels to help spread the air, and lasts a long time.As a bonus it will last a while. I ordered this fan again after the old one quit at the ripe old age of seven.",0.9384
30-Jun-24,5,35,Cooling,Perfect desk fan!,0.7424
26-Jun-24,4,35,Nice sized fan,"I liked because it’s slim and fits into of counter or bedroom furniture.  It’s overall very quiet, another reason I like it. My only dislike is I purchased it for our bedroom and the lights for the button are blue. Very distracting when you’re trying to sleep. I had to over the buttons so the blue light doesn’t shine throughout the room",0.0534

14-Jun-24,3,35,Not quite,"The size is perfect and the air is cool.Unfortunately it isn’t quite like it states.I bought it for my bedside table, it has a constant humming noise,  not the least bit quiet.  I’ve taken to my office instead, it work better there.",0.8553
8-Jun-24,4,35,Lasko,"The light is very bright in a dark room so I had to cover it while using the fan. On the higher speed, it can be very noisy.",0.5423

4-Jun-24,5,35,Works great,Works very well in a small office area,0.3384
26-May-24,4,35,"Louder than I'd like, works great.","Fan works great, two speeds. The motor is a little loud for an office setting with little noise but I've gotten used to it and no one else seems to notice. Works great though, love the oscillating feature.",0.9306
21-May-24,5,35,Powerful,This is the one!!! Most desk fans say that it is “high powered” and I have tried most. This is the only one that I feel like delivers on a hot day!,0.5673
17-May-24,3,35,Makes horribly loud noise.,"I will say that this little fan does a great job of moving air. But that is the only thing it has going for it.This little monster makes a horribly distracting sound. I got it for my nightstand to help keep just me cool at night, but this thing is so loud it drowned out my white noise machine only with a very unpleasant sound. The other issue I have with it, and with most modern electronics, is that it uses those obnoxious bright blue LEDs to backlight the buttons. I ended up moving it to my home office, but the noise it makes is distracting. It does help keep the room cooler so I will keep it but I wouldn't buy another one or suggest it to anyone.",-0.8618
14-May-24,2,35,Noisy despite the small size,"I'm going to return it. It's quite noisy and even makes a high pitched tone. You can hear it in the attached video, and also hear a comparison with a small Honeywell fan. I was hoping since the Lasko was smaller and other reviews said it was quiet, that it would be less noisy than the Honeywell. Sadly that's not the case.Rated 2 stats and not 1 since the price is low and the form factor is nice.",0.1531
14-May-24,5,35,Works as expected,"It's a little loud for me on high speed, but it's also on my nightstand so that would explain the loudness. So far, it's worked really well. This is my second purchase. The first one lasted about three years.",0.4748
8-May-24,1,35,Grinding noise,Not quiet. Makes a grinding sound when turned on.,0
3-May-24,5,35,You have to get one of these!,"Plug and Play is the easiest way to live comfortably in whichever room you are in. This oscillating fan is the best invention since sliced bread! Order yours today!! Oh, and get one for your loved one's, they're affordable too!",0.9616
15-Apr-24,5,35,great little fan,"On my second one( purchasded 2019). My first one lasted over 10 years and in on year 5 with this one. I use it in my office almost daily. While you know it's on when on high, I would not call it noisy. On low, you don't even hear it. Would highly recommend especially for the price.",0.2984
22-Mar-24,3,35,Kinda loud,Its small and powerful but its loud. Not a constant noise but has a clicky sound. I had returned one for a high pitch squealing sound. The second is still pretty loud but at least doesn't have the squealing,0.7351
18-Mar-24,3,35,No tan fresco,"No es lo que esperaba, solo dos velocidades y casi no se diferencia una de otra. Le falta más fuerza. No volvería a hacer una inversión en este ventilador.",-0.6808
19-Jan-24,5,35,Works well,I use this fan daily. It works great over 1 1/2 years later. Purchased a comparable  Vornado 6 months ago and it's already broken. Lasko for the win!,0.8279
17-Jan-24,5,35,Great.,Too small for living room.,0
11-Jan-24,3,35,Gets louder the longer it runs,"Works great for what I purchased it for, to blow across the top of the fireplace to distribute the heat. Runs about 12 to 20 hours per day. I have had it about 2 weeks. Maybe I am over using it, but we will see how long it lasts.I like the slice of air design and openness on the air entry side. It is easy to clean.",0.9493

14-Dec-23,5,35,"Great size for bathroom, desk, or other small areas.",Fair price and fast shipping.,0.3182
6-Dec-23,2,35,Noisy with a high pitch whine,"The fan I received had a pretty substantial high pitch whine, with the general sound being pretty loud for a desk fan sitting right next to you.  I have large tower fans that are quieter.  I might have been able to live with the noise level if it were not for the annoying whine which can be heard from across a large room. I am returning the fan.",0.8849
25-Nov-23,5,35,Fantastic!!!,"This fan is awesome! I use it everyday, all day long at work and it provides a good amount of air. It's not too loud and has great air flow. Great office fan!",0.9656
24-Nov-23,2,35,Not great. Needs better design,"The good: Fan looks decent out of the box and moves air well.The bad: 1) Noise - Moving the air well comes at a cost of noise level. Noise is tinny but probably acceptable for most settings.2) Stability and ease of adjustment - It only comes with 3 rubber feet for stabilization and really needs 4 because the speed and oscillation controls are on the front instead of the top (due to oscillation design). The buttons for power/speed and oscillation require a lot of force when pressed. So when you attempt to turn it on, adjust the speed, or adjust the oscillation...it falls over unless you hold it with two hands.",0.8519

8-Nov-23,3,35,"Loud little fan, LOUD","Compact tower fan.  One airflow setting which is sufficient, but this little guy is LOUD for office setting, to the point it is distracting.  I have other, larger Lasko fans that are very quiet at all settings.  Disappointed and do not recommend.",-0.8387
5-Nov-23,3,35,Just way too noisy,"If this was a quiet fan, I'd give it 4 stars, but it's just way too noisy for its size. In a 3500 sq. ft. home, when the house is quiet, I can hear it running from the opposite end of the house on a different floor.Don't buy this fan. You can do much better for the same money.",0.7838
4-Nov-23,4,35,I like it.,"Needed some extra circulation at my desk and this is doing the trick. Overall good, but a little extra blade girth would quiet this thing down a lot.",0.2144
1-Nov-23,2,35,Very loud,Purchased this same fan in 2017 and had outstanding performanceOut of it but unfortunately it finally died I was so impressed with its performance I ordered another one and right out of the box it sounded terribe makes way to much noise,0.1623

23-Sep-23,1,35,Fan died in 2 years…. I don’t suggest this.,I had purchased a fan and it lasted about 5 years. I expected it to last longer. I purchased a 2nd fan and it died in 2 years. A personal fan that is not overused should last longer than 2 years. Warranty is only for one year. I that this brand was made better. I’m so disappointed. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,0.204
26-Aug-23,5,35,"Great fan, still going after years",We bought this fan for a friend but we have one of our own of the same model and brand that we have been using for years. I have ours right by my computer where I sit daily and have it blowing right on me. Especially great this summer in the heat since our A/C can’t keep up. Highly recommend.,0.9286
27-Jul-23,1,35,Buy different brand,Mine stopped working. Reached out to lasko and I guess I'm outside of warranty period. Most other companies would just replace the defective product without asking 50 questions where I got it and a receipt was required. Avoid lasko.,-0.6808

15-Jul-23,5,35,Big quiet wind for a small device,It's perfect for a small room where counter space is limited.  Just bought my third.  Quiet but provides enough breeze to keep us cool.  Oscillation works well.,0.7579
1-Jul-23,5,35,Surprisingly small but effective,"When the fan arrived, I was surprised at how small the box was.  It says ultra slim, and it is.  Fortunately, the the fan moves a decent amount of air and the noise is subtle and steady.  No bearing noise or wobbly oscillation sounds.  Well done!",0.69

26-Apr-23,4,35,Two Major Problems for me,"I purchased it for bedtime sweats. The size is wonderful the output was good. Everything is great except for two dealbreakers. 1. The power and oscillating buttons are too bright for a bedroom nightstand. 2. The location of the power button can cause the unit to move or tip when pushing it on. If it’s not for your nightstand, then all is perfect. It’s pass my return window so I am placing it in my guest bedroom.",0.9538

28-Jan-23,5,35,Love this fan,Love this fan.  It’s sits on my desk and keeps me cool all day long. The thing I love about it is it’s so quiet and does not have a heavy blow. It’s a perfect scout of air that comes out. It does have 2 settings. My Dad has the tall fan and I’m thinking about getting it as well.,0.9643
12-Oct-22,3,35,Great but smells of plastic when initially starts and also up close,"I got the same one as a gift about 7 yrs ago and had no issues with plasticky smell….btw that one still works great! Super useful, I have it at work. So I am so happy with it that I got one for the house….Smell of plastic is only detectable if you out your nose close to that back membrane thingy that rotates and pushes air around….also when it starts working initially. It has been about a month or two, it does not go away and I use it all the time. So this smell is the reason for 3 rating but the fan is great. Smell not bad enough to return like I returned a sewing bag recently.",0.9778
5-Oct-22,1,35,So Disappointed,"I live in Texas and it gets hot down here. So each morning after I shower, my bathroom gets very hot and humid. I usually turn on my exhaust fan and I like to have a fan blowing on me while putting on my makeup. Trying to clean up my counter space and hoped this fan would be the answers to my problems. The footprint was perfect. I regained some of my much needed counter space real estate.  What more could a girl ask for?Well a girl will want a fan that actually blows enough air to cool her off. This fan had so little power behind it. I can move more air with a handmade paper fan. To add insult to injury, this little thing sounded like a freight train. It was so loud. Even my husband started making fun of my louder than an “airplane engine” fan.Another thing that was an issue. Was turning it off. The on/off  Switch are push buttons. The fan is so too heavy that when you press the buttons it wants to fall over. So you had to use one hand to hold the fan still while using your other hand to actually turn the darn thing off.So sadly this fan went back. I am still on the hunt for the perfect small fan.

20-Aug-22,3,35,Nice while it lasted,"I bought this small fan for use in our RV.  It was a tad small for our RV and did not help much so I used it with better luck for occasional use on our computer desk.  It's been four years and the fan has died.  Is four years acceptable?  I don't think so. Planned obsolescence may help corporations sell more product, but it's destroying our planet.",-0.2684

24-May-22,1,35,Poor quality control,"I bought this to replace a previous Lasko desk fan, same model, that lasted me a solid 6 years before losing the bearings and making noise. This one started making noise from day one. I tried to use it to see if it just needed some breaking in for the bearings to get burned in. But no, it is still incredibly noisy and the return window is expired. Not sure if Lasko's QA has gone downhill since the first time I bought this fan or if I just got a lemon. But I will definitely think twice about buying a third fan. Unfortunate because it was a nice fan.",0.8319

Also, because the fan is light, you have to use two hands to turn it on/off. If you try to turn it on by pressing the button without holding the fan in place it will slide across your desk and tip over. Very poor design.",-0.7879
11-Nov-21,3,35,Not powerful.,I have other Lasko fans that are really powerful. This works fine just more of a personal / desk type fan. I just expected more air especially after watching videos in other reviews.,0.7346
26-Oct-21,3,35,Moves good air but makes an annoying pulsating vibration sound.,"The size is compact, though somewhat tall but overall fits a variety of spaces on a desktop. It moves good air and I have no complaints about cooling off, moving air, etc.The noise it produces however, is suspect. Initially it's a low hum which was great and totally acceptable for an office environment. However, after maybe 2 weeks of use it began producing a higher pitched grinding sound that I'd describe as ""wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha"" as the fan rotates (not oscillates) at speed as if something isn't lubricated correctly or moving freely. That's disappointing as this happens most of the time now. I have to turn it off when taking a call because I'm afraid it will be heard on the other end. Since it was initially quiet, I'm not sure a part or something degraded, or is a QC issue where something is out of spec/alignment. Maybe I'm just unlucky with my unit.Overall - Great air cooling, but my unit has a pulsating grinding sound that is unfortunate and somewhat annoying. I'd only recommend if you're able to quickly return it or have a louder environment where the odd sound won't be an issue.",0.8188

I blew compressed air through it to clean it out. No difference. Resorted to taking it apart, no small fete because of the security star head screws. It seems the shaft of the fan in the upper bearing sets up some sort of harmonics. Tightened both brackets. No amount of lubrication changed it. Buyer beware.",0.1831

24-May-25,5,39.97,Liked these so much I just ordered another one for me and one for my daughter; decently priced,"I initially ordered 4 of these because it's been so hot and humid already this year that the demand on my whole house AC has caused it to struggle to keep things as cool as I like. These have been enough to keep the inside temperature nice and cool while not having to constantly adjust my AC temperature. I turn them on in the afternoon and they allow my AC unit to run more efficiently.  They came fully assembled and ready to go. They're loose inside the box so there's no packaging like styrofoam to mess with. The fans are very lightweight but steady on the floor, and they're easy to move around. I wasn't sure if I was going to like a floor fan, but they are actually pretty nice because you can tilt them up and down unlike the square box fans. That feature allows you not to have them blowing in you right in your face constantly. There are 3 settings - high, medium, and low. Unless you have more than one fan in the same room they are fairly quiet depending on the setting - high being the loudest, and low being the quietest. They haven't been too loud to have to try and talk over or hear the tv, except for the room that I have two in. It's still early summer, but come August when it's the hottest will be the real test. If things change at that time I will update my review. Right now, today, I am very pleased with their preformance and would highly recommend them.",0.9784

24-May-25,2,39.97,Surprisingly not very windy…,"When I purchase any type of fan, it’s always been the Lasko fan because their products last for years. Until I purchased this particular wind machine fan. I was a little leery of the noise level of the unit as I’ve had a wind machine before given to me from a friend. Noise wasn’t the issue with this one. When I turned it on at the lowest level I literally had to stick my hand in front of it. The air flow was so light you’d have to sit in front of it to feel anything. I turned it up one more notch. The noise level increased, but it was still producing less air then my standing fan on low. I’m pretty disappointed in it because I needed it to push air towards rooms that have no ac and I just don’t think it’s going to work. I won’t return it because I already threw the box away.",0.5499

21-May-25,1,39.97,"I did not turn it on, but there is no discernible quality at all in the build/casing","This review is based on build quality and internal packaging, because I returned it due to the plastic casing being broken in several places.  My first impression upon taking it out of the box was POS.  There is no internal packing to keep it from being smashed in transit.  It looks very cheap.  I have 2 other plastic fans, a Honeywell and a Vornado, neither of which look cheap.  Also it is very light and the plastic is very thin.On the outside of the box it says ""Fragile"" but I received it in a slightly, not heavily, smashed box and there was nothing to keep the fan from moving around.  Although I requested it be delivered in Amazon packaging, it was not.  If you think you might want this anyway, because of the Lasko name, try to get it delivered in Amazon packaging.  I think if this were the last fan on earth I might buy it and use it, but otherwise this is seriously not worth more than a couple of bucks.",0.6371

19-May-25,5,39.97,Top pick of a dozen. Tremendous fan.,"This fan is amazing.  I ordered it because we are forewarned this will be a brutal hot summer in our area.  We have had 3 hot summers with 40-50 days in the 90s and last year  a week over 100.  This amazing fan arrived today and I plugged it in on low for a gentle breeze down 30 ft hallway hall into living room. Very quiet, lovely, comfortable summer breeze, I turned it on high and WOW, power plus.  If you are in need of a fan for summer season  order this one fast.  They are fantastic, great price right now. They will  sell out fast. No more silly remotes to loose, no charging batteries or finding one of those hated little cube things.  This fan is all together the easiest most efficient  appliance in my house to plug in and go.  3 tilt positions, 3 speeds, no digital nonsense to fiddle with 6 buttons.  I buy a couple new fans every 3-4 summers.  I have had at least a dozen. Some in the $100s.  This fan is the best of the lot.  No one will dare borrow this one.  This fan is a treasure.",0.9903

In the past I'm always just bought a box fan to place in the window to pull some cool air in, this time for a little bit more money I got the round lasko air circulator (fan lol), one of the nice things is it is durable plastic not brittle plastic plus you can tilt it backwards or forward it doesn't just come straight in the window, three speeds are nice, it circulates great. There is a base, it won't fall over like a box fan in the window. I put this on a folding ""TV tray"", it is the perfect  height to put in front of the windoow.

I don't understand it. Do they now make this same exact fan less powerful and noisier? I'm disappointed.

I put the other in my bedroom and with the fan blowing the floor vent it's very cool and comfortable.  Highly recommend!!,0.9657

9-May-25,5,39.97,Powerful and efficient - excellent product,"I bought this Lasko Wind Machine because I have another Lasko (a 16"" table fan) but needed one for much warmer months with more wind. I can use both by having one blow out one window while the other blows in.This fan ( actually air circulator ) is fantastic. It’s like getting a wind chill in your house.We had some real warm days and I eventually turned on the air conditioning- but I turned it up to 76 ° and pointed the fan directly at the ceiling. It really helped to disperse the cool air that way while not having to turn the air conditioning temperature lower- thereby using less energy.On days where AC isn’t needed, this fan provides a nice breeze with the windows open, blowing that cool air around from outside. ( the house is tight- so when it’s warm in here and a few degrees cooler  outside - this works really well. )Very versatile machine. Can be pointed straight down in winter to disperse warm air, up to spread the cool air- pointing  out the window to exhaust- just a real great circulator all around, with Lasko’s  blue safety plug.I’m enclosing a photo of my Wind Machine. I painted the blue parts white because my decor doesn’t have any blue and I wanted it to blend in rather than stand out. I keep it a room that’s mostly white and seafoam green with a light grey flooring - not the room in the photo.Extremely easy to take apart- the side knobs come off- the handle comes off- easy to clean.Very well built circulator- worked right out of the box. Sturdy and all 3 speeds are powerful. Not real loud even on the highest setting.I get that the cords can’t be super long for a reason but another 10-12"" would give more options for placement since you can not use extension cords with fans or circulators for safety reasons.Still a 5 star 🌟 machine. Definitely recommend!",0.9977

People are doing the old ""switcheroo"" with these and who knows what else.Amazon obviously doesn't check the returns. Avoid buying fans from Amazon.

It is about the same effectiveness as my box fan except it’s quieter which I personally don’t like and it does pivot so you can angle the direction. Other than that. It does not suit my needs.

So now I have one in our bedroom and one in my workout room and they are amazing and I hope this style stays around and this company because for literally generations, this fan isn't too loud for me, produces 3 options that are all useful (low sleeping, high working out) in between cheap and pricy and works better than the over priced ones.

Not necessarily hot or cold air, just neutral as I use them year round.. (I use the lower speed)...not a lot, just enough to keep the room from feeling stuffy or hard to breath.  Also, I need the fan to be very quiet or it keeps me awake. This fan is compact, with 2 speeds, quiet, small enough to move easily, with a reasonable cost and it holds up well. If you need a little more speed or more cooling, high does the job This is my go to fan.  When I wear one out, I just order another.",0.8666

I just love this fan! It is so quiet and puts out just the right amount of airflow, with 2 speed options. I use it mainly in my bathroom, but have also used it while watching TV, and it's so quiet that it doesn't interfere with that. Plus, I love the light weight of it because it makes it so easy to carry and place it wherever I want to. I also love that I can put it close to me when I'm having a hot flash, so it cools me down quickly. I am just so very pleased with everything about it.

24-Feb-25,1,32.99,Wish I had returned,"Waste of money. Wish I had returned this.  This is very cheaply made.  The actual fan blades are just slivers, but the thing that made this garbage to me was the cheap and poorly designed switch mechanism.  The fan has a thin profile and is designed to fit in a narrow place (in my case on a bathroom counter), which it does.  The flimsy switch is in an inconvenient place (the top would have made more sense) and is so cheap that it has to be wiggled to be sure it is seated in the off position and not shorting to the other positions.  The off position is in the middle, with high on one side and low on the other.  I consider it a fire hazard.  It is relatively quiet, but both the other fans I bought (one fatter and one much smaller) move air better.",0.7876

Happy to say the power was only out for 5 hours overnight and this fan came in handy keeping me cool for a few hours of sleep. Lately the weather has been cool at night and I put the fan by the window to save on a/c costs. I noticed the fan would only run on low but stopped on the high setting. I sent an email to the company and explained my concerns and received an answer in 2 hours telling me a refund would show up in my Amazon account. Later that same evening Amazon notified me of the refund. The customer service from Treva is outstanding and will definitely buy from them in the future.,0.9866

It was hot in our house, but I stayed cool by laying in front of this fan pretty much the whole time. You can get about a full 24 hours on one set of batteries (it takes 6 Ds). The fan will still work, but the output lessens as the batteries drain. The noise is still good for sleep, but you’ll need to swap them out to remain cool. We have other battery operated fans that I don’t like as much, and they take 8 batteries. If you have batteries in the fan, it won’t run on a cord.

The fan comes with a remote. The remote needs to be pointed directly to the front. There is a Night feature, which turns off the lights, which is a plus. The cord is about 5’, or less which you may need to take into consideration for where you plan to use it.

I went with this model because of the 8 speeds since most 3 speed fans are too high even on the lowest setting.  Works great!  Remote is simplified and easy to understand.The only drawback and the reason for only 3 stars is that the air vents do not tilt up and down.  As such, you need to be on the exact same height level as the fan in order to get any breeze.  Case in point, my nightstand is 4 inches higher than my mattress and when the fan was turned on and pointed at my pillow, I got hardly any breeze.  I had to put something under the base in order to tilt the entire unit downward.  Not ideal, but it does the trick.",0.4774

The light does turn off if that bothers you. The air flow is super strong very cool breeze.

If you want the tower fan to be quiet, you have to lay it on its side, otherwise the neighbors will complain about the rattling and clanking noise of my fan! Just buy the Dyson.UPDATE: I reached out to the manufacturer and was told by the Dr Prepare Customer Service Team that the fan noise is due to a “swinging head problem”. This is mechanical in nature. However since the fan was purchased on Amazon, they will not refund or replace the fan.

15-Sep-24,3,39.99,Too small for me,"This fan is only effective in quite a small space, and that makes its features and price seem like overkill to me. As other reviewers have noted, the lower settings (1-3) are very light breeze and very quiet. They’re fine for maintaining some air circulation but don’t help to cool very well. The upper settings are more powerful but also more noisy. The main issue in my eyes is that the fan is very short. When it is set on the floor you can’t feel it at face height, even if you’re sitting in a chair. When placed on a table it can be effective; however, the design results in quite a narrow column of moving air and the oscillation feature is quite a slow sweep. I find that this just doesn’t cool a space (or me) as effectively as something like a round oscillating fan. I bought it for use in my bedroom but have ended up using it on the counter in the kitchen to blow right at me (and only me) while cooking in hot weather. Since it has to be close by to be effective, the remote control seems superfluous… and it has to be pointed at the sensor just right… which often necessitates walking over to the fan to get the right angle. Is it a fan that moves air? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Would I buy another? Nope!",0.9948

The screws all come in the place they go, but the base has a weird set up and good luck with the lack of decent directions.It’s quiet. Good air flow. But NOPE not the smell!

25-May-25,1,39.59,Worst fan to assemble,"UPDATE- dropped it down to 1 star because it has heated up smells like my old sewing machine oil. It’s not on, only plugged in. This is dangerous. Didn’t expect this so I don’t have the box to return it. Worst purchase.This is not the first fan I’ve purchased and attempted to assemble, but it’s the worst. Took over an hour, turned it on and it didn’t spun. Took the front housing off, spun manually and it then started spinning. I loosened the cap, put the housing back on, didn’t spin. The next day, I tried again. No go. It’s now without the front housing. Ridiculous. Not returning, too much of a hassle, but I don’t recommend this. There are other fans that function far better and aren’t a pain in the butt to assemble. Buy one of those.",-0.9243

I was on the hunt for a metal fan since they blow air far better than plastic fans so I bought this one in copper.The written instructions were very small, the picture talking about what was what unfortunately was faded and could barely be seen. Thankfully even without instructions this fan is very simple to assemble.This thing BLOWS air, so if you’re looking for feeling like you’re in a wind tunnel then this is for you. It can be somewhat loud when on high, but that’s to be expected with any fan. It is heavy and held it place extremely well by the base weight it comes with, so you won’t have to experience shaking unless you didn’t properly tighten some pieces.Overall I’m extremely happy with this purchase.",0.9573

Placed it in one of the bedrooms as I was embarrassed to put it anywhere else and am not confident in the longevity.  I had my doubts when reading other reviews; however, the cheapness is real.

27-Feb-25,3,39.59,Beautiful.. but missing parts,"Alright, let me just say—I am OBSESSED with how this Holmes 16"" Copper Digital Metal Stand Fan looks. The Coppertone finish makes it look like it belongs in some fancy old-timey library where rich people sip whiskey and talk about ""the economy."" It’s got major vintage vibes but with modern features, which I love. The remote control is also a game-changer. I don’t have to move an inch to adjust the speed or oscillation—pure luxury.But, of course, my excitement was immediately tested because—guess what was missing from the brand-new box? The anchor screws that actually hold the fan to the stand. You know, a crucial part of making sure it doesn’t fall over like a sad, expensive paperweight. Returning it would’ve been a pain, so I took matters into my own hands.Cue me standing in Home Depot, trying to explain to the poor employee that I needed “fan screws” without having any clue what size they were. He looked at me like I had three heads before finally just handing me a variety pack and wishing me luck. After some trial and error (and probably concerning my neighbors with my excessive use of profanity), I finally found ones that fit.Once assembled, though? Absolute perfection. It’s quiet, powerful, and looks like something Gatsby himself would’ve owned. If it came with all its parts, it’d be an 11/10. But since I had to go on a screw-hunting adventure, solid 9/10.",0.9802

15-Apr-25,5,35,Foldable and portable,"I love this fan! The best feature is that it oscillates and I can run this fan all day without having to charge it immediately. It’s lightweight, but heavy enough that it doesn’t tip over. I’ve purchased other foldable fans that are too light and easily break. I like that I can fold it and take it with me. This is the better brand of these types of fans. I’m very satisfied.",0.97
8-Apr-25,2,35,Broke in less than 24hrs,"I wanted to like this so bad, it fit perfect in my bed room, compact yet just the right height and the fan worked for maybe an hour, went to charge it (it takes a long time) and took it off the charger and will no longer turn back on or charge, haven’t even had it for 24hrs and already broke, definitely disappointed, threw away packaging too soon and don’t think I’ll be able to return it.",0.2665

24-Mar-25,1,35,Not safe,If I could give this fan zero stars I would. This is the second fan I’ve bought from this company. It’s a great idea but it only last maybe 2 months. After a while it will stop working without  being plugged in. It eventually stops working all together. It’s makes this weird humming sound even when unplugged like it’s about to explode. It has happened both times. I wish they would refund me. I will never order from this company again. This product is not safe.,0.4001
23-Mar-25,3,35,Probably not for everyday use,"Probably good for occasional use. I bought it originally for just that, but then my fan in my bedroom died so I started using this fan every night. I love having the remote and the different levels the only issue was having to get up to change the level of the fan but it wasn't a huge deal since it is meant to be for travel anyway but fast forward about 6 months and it can't be on any level other than low without dying or making this awful clicking noise, fast forward another few months and it turns on and immediately dies. I took it apart to see if it were salvageable and without changing some of the electronics inside it was not.",0.3279

15-Mar-25,3,35,Poor fan oscillation,"I purchased this fan last year in preparation for hurricane season in Florida. The overall performance was pretty good; the 4 different fan speed settings are great! It was able to run for around 8 hours on the first setting and the air flow is ok. However, I was disappointed with the oscillation. Most of the time it doesn’t move and, if it does move, it’s very jerky and pauses a lot. I was expecting a smooth glide. Because that was a feature I specifically looked for and was disappointed, I’m rating it a 3.",0.8488

It is great for traveling, but not as a standard bedroom fan for it is too small to really make much of a difference. I was trying to unplug the USB-C and the connector part was stuck in the fan and it won't charge anymore therefore it is dead and broken. I'm extremely frustrated I can't return it when it hasn't even been 60 days. I wouldn't recommend this fan.",-0.6616
18-Oct-24,5,35,Perfect quiet camping fan,"This fan works great and stays running all night. The remote works well. The led light can be bright, but just cover that up if it's to much.

5-Sep-24,1,35,Terrible longevity,"It worked very well for less than 4 weeks. Then every time i turned it on, the blades would turn but it wouldn’t blow air.

20-Aug-24,2,35,Eh.,"The fan was okay, it would stop circulating on its own but I could live with that. The fan speeds were good and it wasn’t too loud. After having it for 10 days it stopped working. It just wouldn’t turn on. I would even turn it off when I wasn’t home after reading the reviews and a few others said it just stopped working for them as well. It is probably a great fan for a trip or being used outside for a few hours but not great for daily use.",0.8862

6-Aug-24,2,35,Nice when it works,It's nice when it works but stopped working correctly after a couple of months.  When it doesn't work the fan spins louder but less wind comes out of the fan.  After a while the noise goes away and it's back to normal.,0.0147

The adjustable height means I can put it on a nightstand when traveling or on the floor at work. The speeds provide gentle to brisk cooling when plugged in.

I cover the lights with a sock.I’m sure sales on this fan went up when I posted about it in a cruise group on Facebook.

19-Jan-24,4,35,Great Fan for a Cruise,"This fan was purchased for a cruise as it has a USB connection for charging and the electrician passed it as safe for use on their cruise ship (Disney). It was very quiet and the battery lasted all night on the lowest setting, perfect for a breeze whilst sat on the balcony and sleeping. It charged fairly quickly as well.

However, after just seven months of use, it suddenly stopped working altogether.It’s disappointing to invest in a product that only lasts a short time.

14-Jun-24,5,33.99,Single best vacation purchase,"We went to Cancun for a week, they are in a heat wave at the moment and either our resort just lost power a few times or the city may have had a few blackouts. Either way, even when the power was on, it was hot. Like the sun chasing Mario on that one super mario level from when I was a kid hot. I bought two of these and we used them in our room at night, we took them to the buffet in the mornings with us, and we had them by the pool. I probably had 50 or more people, from guests to employees asking me where I got the fans.They pack up small enough to throw in a backpack or beach bag, they hold a charge really well but also will run the entire day if you just connect them to a portable charging brick. We didn't use the remote much but we did use the oscillating function all the time. I was worried the 8 inch wouldn't provide much air/circulation (I couldn't get the larger fan to the house in time for our vacation so I braved the 8 inch). I shouldn't have worried at all, this fan is shockingly powerful especially for how small it is. Sometimes it sat on our table, at night we raised it to its full height, when we had a palapa/cabana it sat on the ""bed"" with us and two wiggly kiddos didn't even knock them over.I seriously feel like amazon should pay me for how much I advertised this fan while we were out it was PERFECT. If I'm traveling to a tropical environment or camping I will definitely have one of these with me. My husband is even considering changing his bedside fan over to one of these.",0.988

23-Mar-24,5,33.99,Great fan! Worth getting.,I haven’t used the remote since I’m usually not a remote person for these type of devices. Same with mini heater I don’t usually  use one. But I wanted to share that I’m really impressed with this fan and when it is fully charged and you use it unplug. It actually lasts a long time on the low setting. Higher setting you to expect to need to plug back in but it still lasts long. Long enough if there were a temp power outage. I like the size can easily travel and take it anywhere in your travel backpack or carry on. I have it in different places in my room easy to transport and stable. Only thing is I wish it came with a wall plug. I had to get that separate but the usb is universal that it comes with it. Wish that cord was longer too but you can replace with a longer one. The other only downside is the higher the setting is the louder it is. But it is otherwise a nice quiet strong fan. I still gave it 5 stars because of compactness and sturdy niece.

So I went on the hunt. This was my second purchase, the first style and brand didn’t work. I gave this one a shot. It was perfect in many ways. First the battery, doesn’t go all night but if you need it several hours unplugged it will do well. The cord was slightly too short but doesn’t detract from this being a fantastic buy. The air movement from this little guy was impressive. And surprisingly it isn’t loud, we could barely hear it.  Really enjoyed having the different speeds also. Bonus features: you can set it to different heights in a snap, tilt the head up and down and move the direction of air flow side to side.  When you are done, it folds up nice and neat and ready to use again the next time. The remote was handy too.  I feel like this was a great buy and will use it in all my travels.

Much lower than any other fan of this type I have ever owned for sure. I really feel it should be better for something I had to put together! I suspect that companies save money further in returns because who wants to build a thing and ten take it apart to return it for ""meager air flow"".They won. I am keeping it because I can't be bothered to take it back apart to simply return it. I would not purchase it again (I foolishly purchased THREE, and put all of them together before testing them!).

After 2 years of only indoor use, during the summer months, and never in direct sunlight, the plastic cover for the back area of the fans disintegrates to the touch.  Literally.  It was almost laughable.  However, after I gently attempted to tilt one of the fans slightly down, the plastic lattice back cover completely gave way, crumbled and the moving blades sliced my index and middle finger open.  After bandaging myself up, I inspected one of the other fans while it was unplugged.  It too fell apart when only light pressure was applied. The plastic cover on the back for the blades was clearly not manufactured with the intent to last.

12-May-25,5,34.99,Replacing 10-year old same center-swivel Lasko - Awesome #4916 product!,"First, I was replacing the former model of this very make/shape/design of fan from almost a decade ago. Shape = the top half can be moved left or right and blows a different direction than the bottom, where it always seems like it covers far more blow-area than you might ever imagine for my old 14"" fan. My old model only difference to this 4916 model I now confirm was only old one a turnie-knob to select speed/oscillate, rather than this new one with 2 push buttons.  Did I mention my old Lasko lasted 10 years?When I shopped here for a replacement, oh I looked at many brands, all cheaper really.  Good stuff, reviews were good. Some big name recognizable makes, some remotes, some even had the temperature showing on them lol.  I only need to know ""I'm hot"" or ""I'm not hot"" - not a number, so that one makes me laff, but I digress again...So I shopped and shopped.  I found cheaper, but none had that center-swivel thing going for it.  Its a manual thing - nothing fancy, it just really reeeeeally widens the blow-area covered, and in a split-second reach you can adjust it anytime. Lasko was the only one that had it in the 14"" like my old 14"" size, so this I paid just a smidge more for, no remote, no bells whistles, two pushbuttons, manual swivel, same space it will take up standing on the table in the room I need it in.  If you have a small space to use this fan in, you won't believe how much difference that manual-twistie swivel option in the middle makes until you actually use one of these.I got model # 4916 black from this ad.  It arrived identical size as the one I got rid of.  That was still working fine, it just got that musty smell after 10 years is all.* Running, this new one is (the same) whisper quiet, in a tiny little echoey room.  The buttons don't ""beep"" like my tower fans - in the middle of the night - tG.  Had I got a different non-Lasko fan it might have beeped and for some reason I just don't like the ones that do that.  Unnecessary really.  The old one did not beep, the new one/this one does not beep.  It has no remote, but in a tiny room/on tabletop, ya gotta walk by it anyway.* What else matters, I think to self?  It matters that the Lasko fan I got rid of was a decade old, exact model except for knob to push button it turns out, and the old one lasted that long.  I could have saved a few measly single US dollars getting any other 14-inch-ish tall fan I found - with no pivot covering less blow-area - and taken 100% chance the fan wouldn't do ** exactly what I needed it to continue doing **, or I could get this one and hope for quiet, about the same item, and get 'er done as well.  And it did.  I win!I am so glad I thought it out and got this model 4916 Lasko. Shipping was predictable, reliable, packing was great, arrived in new/perfect condition as ordered, to tabletop and plug 'er in and manually swiveled the center of it, and within what was it less than 2 minutes my reliable Lasko was... back.I cannot speak for the 4911 shorter one.  It would have been too short for my same room area-coverage.  I cannot speak for the 4910 which is 14"", but I chose the 4916 instead because I was hoping for the newest model available and getting another 10 years of great Lasko operation, where I can be happy to know:  In the future, save my time, just get the Lasko.  And now I know I can come back to this seller and get exactly what was promised.  Yay!",0.9971

I love that it has two separate fan units, each of which can be independently adjusted in different directions. The fan has three speed settings (low, medium and high) and it can be set to oscillate or stand still. It’s hard to find good fans with these options. I gave this 4 stars as I think the price is reasonable, however, I had problems with the high setting on the first fan right from the start. It was unreasonably loud and vibrated  enough that I had to put a small piece of carpet under it. I had the first fan for 3 years, the motor was dying and would only run on the highest setting which was annoyingly loud. When it began to sound like a ‘78 Buick with a bad starter & COPD, I finally relented and bought a new one. I have been somewhat disappointed with Lasko about this fan not lasting longer & the problems right out of the gate. I would’ve requested a warranty for replacement, but life got busy.

28-Jul-24,5,34.99,Does the job and then some.,"We've found this summer that the ole AC is having a hard time keeping up with the heat.  So the better half wanted something small and that could be aimed at her while she's working at her computer desk.I did a little bit of looking and saw this, and figured we'd give it a try.  We've used Lasko products throughout the years and they deliver.So far it's not to shabby, as others have said the high setting does give out a bit of noise, but realistically to us its the only setting she likes, well, maybe the middle speed.  The low speed, doesn't seem to push out much air at all.  We've found that we like it all together, meaning the top piece facing the same direction for the best air flow.The cats seem to like it as well.  The better half likes it, and that's really all that matter.  I can't attest to durability or the like, till we've had it a bit longer.  I have two standing lasko's now that we still use and we've had those for years.  They still do the job well.",0.9889

8-Jul-24,4,34.99,"Versatile, Space-Saving, But A Tad Weak","Purchased for use as a bedside fan to provide a cool breeze and background noise.Pros:-Vertical design makes it SUPER easy to place on smaller surfaces/tables. I specifically bought this because I had a smaller nightstand and my other fan was just too bulky.-Fans can be adjusted to blow in different directions - meaning I could consistently have one pointed to my face and the other to my body, without having to use oscillating mode.-CRAZY QUIET - which technically doesn't help me as I wanted some background noise, but still it's impressively quiet.-Pretty durable - I have a toddler who has sent this thing flying to the floor several times and it barely even left a mark.Cons:-Buttons are inlaid to the base and reaching over and fiddling with them is sometimes annoying as you have to press decently firm to get it to register.-Buttons are used to adjust speed, so if I want it on low, I have to press power three times, as opposed to moving a dial with most other fans-Fan doesn't put out as much air as I would like for my purposes. I imagine as a desk fan in an office, this would be perfect, but for a bedroom fan, it just doesn't reach to the end of the bed.",0.9683

25-May-24,1,34.99,It’s small enough to have a spot on the desk.,"It’s cute and is about the size of a desk lamp. It doesn’t take much space.What was misleading is that the top half remains stationary during oscillation. I didn’t see the description mention that it doesn’t have the ability to oscillate separate from the bottom half. I was under the impression, from the pictures, that it was able to move in the opposite direction while in motion with the bottom half.It’s not LOUD and annoying but even though you can still hear it, it’s not too noisy where it’s distracting while taking calls.The power button controls the three different speeds with each depression. The oscillate button only has the one function.The airflow is decent but isn’t very strong at the highest speed. If you’re someone that needs to have your hair whipping in the wind, then this may not be the fan for you.Since I live in the desert & the office is the hottest room in the house, then we’ll see how it fares when temperatures are in the hundreds. I might just have to update this review if it doesn’t do the trick.**UPDATE** I changed my 3 ⭐️ to 1 since I’m having to fan shop again. It worked just fine in the HOT summer but I’m VERY disappointed that this new fan only lasted a few months. I’ve had it for almost a year now, but by September, it was no longer working. I only used it when I’d work and for $30, I expected this to give me at least a year. Instead, I only got (maybe) 4 months out of it. I usually like Lasko fans, in fact, most of the ones I have is Lasko. With this one not making it to 6 months of good use, I’ve started to question purchasing any more of their products.

15-Apr-24,2,34.99,Not much air flow,This fan is a newer model than our old one. It’s so lightweight that the whole fan slides away when you push the power button and unless you’re pretty close to it you can’t feel much air coming from it.  Also I mostly use it for noise at night and it’s not near as noisy as our old one. The handle in the back isn’t deep enough to pick it up and carry it so be careful if trying to pick it up that way or youll drop it.

I just see no reason to have cold air on my toes. But my daughter does get really hot feet easily and this may work perfect for her and her cubicle. She's always taking off her shoes and socks.

When I told them that I did not have confidence in this duo form any more, they were willing to send a round fan replacement unit of similar cost instead. 5-stars to Vornado customer service!  If you think this duo fan function is what you need, you can try it and have confidence that Vornado will make things right if you get a bad unit. I am leaving my original review and not changing my star rating for future purchasers.7/21/24: I ordered this fan with high hopes that it could be used to draw air in from my window and as a general air circulator in my apartment. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed fairly quickly. Straight out of the box, this fan was a disappointment in terms of noise, but that has only gotten worse over the past month. In the vertical position, the fan makes a grinding noise--just loud enough to really get on the nerves, and in the horizontal position it has woken me up several times by when it starts to make a whistle/flutey noise.I do not recommend this fan to anyone. I am past the return date, so will be contacting Vornado about a return or a fix.  In the meantime, I purchased a different Vornado fan that works great (533DC Energy Smart Small Air Circulator) and am happily using that instead of this useless thing.",0.9539

You literally need to have it a foot or two away to feel the air movement. It also beeps everytime you turn it on/off or lower the speed. I'm not sure why you would ever use any of the three lower speeds, barely pushes any air on high. You also need to push the button four times to rotate through all the speeds before it will turn off — many times it will be on the lowest speed when I thought it was turned off, that's how weak it is. Horrible design, Vornano should not even sell these.",-0.8467
30-Jun-24,5,33.96,Fantastic Fan,"This is better than my Dyson, which cost way more. Great design in the fact you can place it vertically or horizontally. I absolutely love it and it’s well worth the money. Highly recommend and I live in sweltering Texas!",0.9576
28-Jun-24,2,33.96,Not great,I was really excited at the idea of being able to turn the fan on it's side or stand it up. But it's not very powerful and it's loud.

18-Jun-24,1,33.96,Cannot use because of the higher pitched motor hum/coil whine.,"Size is great but the build quality and motor are BAD. Moves air in a focused way that's actually perfect for a little desk fan, problem is on settings 2-4 there's a loud motor hum. It sounds almost exactly like really bad coil whine. Anyone that has had a computer with a low grade power supply or any modern large video card would know and hate this sound.If you have any sort of sound sensitivity or just hate coil whine stay far away. And! the plastic is bad, with poor tolerances that gives it a little wobble sound at setting 1. speed 2 is about the only setting that sounded ok/meh, but at that speed it doesn't move enough air for me.Sound Details: On speed 4(max) its at 175hz F3 note at a very annoying level 62db using a phone app, so grain of salt, but can say its far too loud to be on my desk or even across the room, and speed 3 its about 136 C#3, app was saying around 55db for that, Still not at all tolerable for me but I could see some people being ok with it. For reference the top E on a guitar is 82hz or E2 and the bottom E string(the higher sounding one) is at 330hz, E4 and still too loud for me with the fan about15 feet away across the room. The noise appears to be coming from the motor and sounds like bad electrical hum. Its not a pleasant white noise sound at all you expect from a fan, just grating.",-0.9848
13-Jun-24,5,33.96,Just Love this product,"First, I live in Las Vegas, and it has been very hot I was at my doctor's office and while I was waiting in the room for the doctor, I was feeling a great breeze, and I noticed this fan on the counter, so I took a picture and when I got home went to my computer and ordered one on amazon.

And if you need a fan that is of a very slim design, and can be turned so that it is either vertical or horizontal then this is the fan for you. If you are trying to cool any area larger than 3 feet in front of you this is not the fan for you, particularly at this cost, I wish I had returned it.

A solid value for the price, solidly built and doesn’t feel cheap at all.  If i had to be SUPER picky, a remote would have been nice and oscillation would also have been nice.

8-Sep-23,3,33.96,I'm less impressed,"I bought a ""Vornado 573 Compact Flat Panel Air Circulator Fan, 3 Speeds, Moves Air 60 Feet"" and love it.  It has great power.> Initial disappointment with this was my fault.  I thought it oscilated, but it doesnt.  I think their marketing department is why I dont like marketing.  They arent client facing so they feel like they can say whatever they want.  This doesnt oscilate it is multi-directional.... which means you can stand it up or lay it down or reposition it manually as you choose.  OK.. I can get over that.  No biggie.>Says it's quit and pushes air up to 50ft.  My other says 60 feet and that throws a lot of air.  This one with max fan @20' I could feel it, but barely.  Its not on the same level as the other.  I have this positioned on the window ledge just beyond my laptop.  I'm 2' away.  On level 1 it is quite and I can feel a gentle breeze.  level 2 - Throws noticably better air and is noticably nosier.  level 3 - Throws more air than level 2, but noise level is relatively higher than the level of increased airflow.  Level 4 is noisy.>Directionally, the graphics for this fan show equal air coming out across the length of the blades.  That isnt my experience.  The bottom 2"" most of the air flow seems to come from the middle of the blade area and seems exactly like my old tower fan.I got my old tower fan 3 years ago at Costco in a 2-pack for either $19 or $29 for a 2 pack.  I paid $40 for this ONLY because it is a Vornado and i'm extremely happy with my other Vornado.Would I buy it again knowing what I know.  Nope.Will I return it - Probably not.  it has been blazing hot this past week and the pain in the ass of looking for another fan isnt worth it.I liked the old fan better.  It was also a similar sized tower fan.  It was 3 speeds with a timer and ocilation.  I think it moved as much air.  This feels expensive for what it is.  The old one lasted 3 years.  I hope this one lasts.",0.9864
6-Sep-23,5,33.96,Best fan for its size,This is probably the best air circulation fan I've ever used. Small and compact. Moves air around like a large fan. My recommendation is buy one when you get the chance. You won't be disappointed,0.9307

This fan is not very strong compared to the others. You also need to make absolutely sure nothing causes a blockage else the fan will begin to freak out and sound like it is going to burn out.

25-Aug-23,1,33.96,Broke after a month of use,"1 month after buying this fan, it stopped working. We used it in our bedroom at night and we weren't impressed with it much when it was functioning. It is difficult to aim where you want it to go because the base is fixed. You can either set it vertically or horizontally on a surface, but you can't tilt it or rotate it at all.

It has a unique horizontal and vertical foot that was perfect for my intended use.The flaw is insurmountable; when you turn of the power to the fan with a wall switch, smart switch, power strip, etc it doesn’t remember its last setting/speed. It just stays off until you physically go to the unit and push the power on/speed toggle. If there was a remote I’d give it a 4/5 but with no remote it’s ridiculous. You can’t use a timer or a smart outlet to turn it off/on. 0/5 for my use case. 1/5 because that’s as low as Amazon allows.",0.3818

On the second level, the noise is tolerable (but you know... still exists...) and it only pushes air for about 5 feet. This fan does not oscillate so the use case for it is pretty slim. I wanted it for my office, under my desk, but it is too loud for that. And the lack of a remote means bending to turn it on/off or adjust the level.
