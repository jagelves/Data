However, something is always rattling or making noises. I figured it is just part of the operation. I had 3 others in the office buy the same fan after they saw mine and they all make a slightly different noise, but they are still quiet and push a lot of air.Being that this fan is the 'blower' type or 'hamster wheel' type it really does push a lot of air. And you do not get the swirling effect that normal fan blades create, or the slicing of the air effect. This one feels good when it is blowing on you, but you may want to have it oscillate because if it is blowing on my face as I am working on the computer it makes my eyes very dry and I cannot have it blowing on me for too long.

The high speed is too loud if you are on the phone around your co-workers. The low speed is the quiet setting and it still pushes plenty of air.

After a week of use at work, I really like it.  It uses very little space so it doesn't get in the way.  Strong enough to provide enough air circulation to keep me cool.  Some of my office co-workers have even asked about it, they found it to be very stylish.

The machine is very quiet to me, but then agian, I also have the central air blowing overhead so I cannot tell and cannot review the sound part. The design is very sleek and looks great in a professional setting.Attached are photos of the machine and it's size next to a regular water bottle. Also is a sticky note being blown on LOW setting so you can till see the power it has. I reccomend purchasing this product. Let's see how it holds up when NYC hits the high 90's this summer! Wish me luck!"

It's a fan.....I have fixed many things so...Me and my son opened it up and glued the parts that were broke back to place.  Fan works great and Momma loves it. It makes a high pitch sound when running but not so bad I wanna throw it away.  lol  We don't use the remote...As a matter of fact...I don't remember even seeing it...Oh well.. I am a second customer of this fan.  It works now and I will continue to shop Amazon for very affordable things.  :)

Seems simple enough, and it worked well with the other fan.. NOT THIS ONE.Pros: It was cheap enough, and it was quiet enough even though it only had two speeds (low was more like Medium and HiGH was too high and noisy).  I had it running pretty much continuously for the first week. Then it got cold out and I turned it off one day. That night I tried to lean over to turn it on, and that's when you realize design flaws. First, the buttons aren't on the top, so that you can just push down with a single finger. The fan sits on the shelf attached to the side of the waterbed and is on the outside of the headboard, so I had to get up every time I wanted to turn it on, because you had to push the buttons with so much force that it just slid around. You had to use both hands to turn it on; one hand to hold the top of it, the other hand to hold the bottom of it and then use your thumb to turn it on. I had it for several weeks of annoying agitation, and since it worked okay, I certainly couldn't return it just because I didn't like it.  So I did the next best thing.. I bought a replacement that has the buttons on the top, and then I took this one outside and ran over the P.O.S. with my Big Truck Tires !!

NOT THIS ONE.Pros: It was cheap enough, and it was quiet enough even though it only had two speeds (low was more like Medium and HiGH was too high and noisy).  I had it running pretty much continuously for the first week. Then it got cold out and I turned it off one day. That night I tried to lean over to turn it on, and that's when you realize design flaws. First, the buttons aren't on the top, so that you can just push down with a single finger. The fan sits on the shelf attached to the side of the waterbed and is on the outside of the headboard, so I had to get up every time I wanted to turn it on, because you had to push the buttons with so much force that it just slid around. You had to use both hands to turn it on; one hand to hold the top of it, the other hand to hold the bottom of it and then use your thumb to turn it on. I had it for several weeks of annoying agitation, and since it worked okay, I certainly couldn't return it just because I didn't like it.  So I did the next best thing.. I bought a replacement that has the buttons on the top, and then I took this one outside and ran over the P.O.S. with my Big Truck Tires !!  The satisfaction was immeasureable as I heard its little plastic guts crackle and crush under the weight of my off road tires.... Then I happily swept it up and put the remains in the trash, to never be bothered with such a flaw ridden design of a device ever again..."

As well I have squirted a couple sprays of WD-40.So if you too are sitting in one place and need a companion to sit with you, always reminding you of the freedom you lack.THIS FAN IS THE ONE YOU WANT."

There IS no better non-oscillating fan, in my opinion. I only add the non-oscillating part because my husband sleeps with one of those fans that goes back and forth, and after years of The Great Fan Debate we've just decided they're totally separate categories.Here's why this one is the best;1. It's a serious trooper. My parents had theirs for years before they gave it to ME. Then it performed flawlessly even when moved frequently and used OFTEN. The ONLY reason it finally died was harassment from a truly demented Siamese cat moving at high speed doing things the manufacturer NEVER intended. Just...trust me on this.2. The air flow is AMAZING. It moves so much air so evenly that I STILL say it makes oscillating just plain unnecessary, and that's on ""low"". I put this in a room at one end of the house and push air through from one end of the house to the other, steadily but unobtrusively on the ground floor. The 2nd fan is upstairs (one very large bedroom).3. The versatility is stupendous. You can mount it on a wall, or you can almost effortlessly just pick it up and put it in any room. It tilts and stays precisely at the angle you put it at.Like most larger fans, it takes a bit of time to take it apart and clean it. No, not my favorite chore, BUT I honestly don't see how they could make it easier to take apart to clean without sacrificing the durability. And I'd rather have these fans that will last a LONG time (said Siamese cat has found other obsessions) than one of my husband's easier to clean fans that MAYBE last 2 years before they start to wobble or just break.They're not silent, but I really don't care.

During one that lasted several hours, I ended up driving across town and taking my elderly dog shopping, just to get her inside somewhere that had a/c.  More recently, we've had some short power outages, lasting maybe an hour each.  Still, that's enough time for my apartment to go from slightly-warmer-than-I'd-like to my-living-room-is-a-burning-hell.  Looking for a back-up plan, I decided to see if battery operated fans were even a thing, and that's when I found this O2Cool fan.  I was a little nervous about buying it, since a few reviewers said theirs didn't work or didn't last, but a few reviews from hurricane areas had me wanting to give it a try.  So I ordered one and crossed my fingers.TL;DR: Awesome fan, works great!First off, I like the size and design.  This isn't one of those tiny palm-sized USB fans; it's about a foot wide in total, with a 10"" span inside for the actual fan blades.  It's slightly taller than it is wide, but it's depth is pretty compact.  The vented cover is sized just right for me to not accidentally slip a finger inside when I pick it up, though it does have a carrying handle if you want to play it really safe.  It does come with an A/C adapter, which I guess is nice, but I don't really need.  Then again, it may come in handy if one of my two regular fans goes out and I need a temporary replacement.It's kind of a battery hog in that it needs 6 D-batteries to run, but honestly, I think that's a good thing.  Any less, and it'd be a much smaller, weaker fan that wouldn't last any time at all.  I haven't had occasion to run it for hours and hours and hours, but according to other customers, it lasts 9+ hours on high and even longer on low.  I think that will be plenty to get me through the next power outage.  And about those low and high speeds... This thing has great air flow.  I wouldn't want to set it up 10 feet away from me, but since it's not tied to a cord or outlet, that won't be a problem.  On low speed, there's plenty of air flow, and on high speed, it's awesome.  It's slightly less powerful than the 22"" corded turbo fans I use on a daily basis.All in all, I'd say this is an awesome buy.  I was impressed enough with the first one that I immediately ordered a second, and both work very well with both the A/C adapter and batteries.  I'm stocked up on D batteries now, too, so it looks like I'm set to ride out the next power outage in comfort!Update 12/1/2108:  I bought two of these fans to get me through a power outage, which hasn't happened yet.  But a few weeks ago, my apartment's a/c went out in the middle of the night, and the two fans I brought into the bedroom just weren't enough.  I ended up grabbing one of these battery operated fans, intending to use the included A/C cord, and set it up on my nightstand.  But in my sleepy, overheated stupor, I turned it on and quickly fell asleep -- forgetting to plug it in.  Six hours later, I woke up and called maintenance, and they had my a/c fixed fast.  Then I went to unplug and put away this fan, only to realize I'd left it running on high for 6 hours on nothing but battery power!  So yes, I can now say without a doubt that these little fans run great for at least several hours.Update: Here I am. Power outage. Texas. Summer. While my neighbors sit in their doorways trying to catch a weak breeze, my dog and I are comfortably lounging on the sofa, a fan trained on each of us, while she sleeps and I read my Kindle.

I was left to the mercy of the university to send someone out to fix since we are not allowed to mess with at all.

I can set it in the corner and be able to utilize my desktop for either my laptop or for Home Work.To my amazement this little fan blows air very well. It has two settings for how hard it blows air. the lowest is usually enough for me since I have facing towards my face on my desktop but even on the highest I don't get that feeling of being smacked in the face by the air.It isn't ""weak"" but it isn't powerful like an industrial fan. If need a heavy duty fan then buy an industrial one. I obviously don't need such a large fan in my dorm and doubt it would even be allowed.Fairly quiet and sound isn't annoying. I find it soothing when my dorm room is completely silent.I use the adapter and don't really use the batteries because I leave it on almost all day 24/7.

It has two settings for how hard it blows air. the lowest is usually enough for me since I have facing towards my face on my desktop but even on the highest I don't get that feeling of being smacked in the face by the air.It isn't ""weak"" but it isn't powerful like an industrial fan. If need a heavy duty fan then buy an industrial one. I obviously don't need such a large fan in my dorm and doubt it would even be allowed.Fairly quiet and sound isn't annoying. I find it soothing when my dorm room is completely silent.I use the adapter and don't really use the batteries because I leave it on almost all day 24/7. So I am able to tell you how long it lasts on batteries but it requires 4 D batteries so it should last a decent amount.Cons:nonewill keep review updated on status on my fan or if it ever ""goes out"".The price on this is very reasonable. I didn't want a complicated / high-tech fan that had tons of settings. I just wanted something simple but functional and durable. Looking at the reviews on amazon I decided this O2COOL fan W/adapter was just what I was looking for."

I take it with me to league night bowling as it tends to get pretty stuffy in there. On high it has plenty of air flow to keep my grip hand and face dry.Con 1: Eats batteries really fast on high. I solved this in a round-about way. Rather than using lower voltage rechargeable NiMH batteries, I used a USB battery pack (10.5Ah@5V) capable of delivering 2.1A and a 5V to 9V converter to use for the power input port (a standard 2.1 x 5.5mm barrel connector). When I tried to run it straight, it would not run the fan on high speed. After adding a 47µF capacitor to the boost converter output to counteract the inductive load of the motor, it ran just fine. Seems to be supplying about 900mA at 9V to the fan on high, which is strange given that the supplied AC adapter is only rated to supply 700mA. Using this improvised external battery, the fan does seem to push more air than it did with fresh copper-top D-cell batteries. I suppose that makes sense with power loss and voltage sag of alkaline cells nearing 1A of current draw. I think it would be a much better design if they used some 18650 or 26650 lithium ion batteries that users could swap out on occasion. Alkaline cells just aren't a good choice for high current draw applications like this. Even NiMH batteries would be acceptable if you could use 8 of them to keep the voltage around 9V.Con 2: The switch is incredibly easy to switch. Too easy, in fact. If you leave it somewhere where it can be wiggled any (like, say, a car), it is really easy for the switch to be flipped on just by the fan rubbing against something else.Con 3: I don't like the angle that the fan points. As it is right now, it generally points at my chest while I would like it better if it pointed more upward to keep my face dry. Which means that I either have to duck like I'm hiding from someone or grab the fan and hold it tilted back.

I have to say this MODEL is much better than a Coleman I had.  My Coleman took 6-8 D cell batteries and barely lasted 8 hours.  And I ran it on high and low settings.  It still has power to run!!!Also I used the AC adapter when I got it to compare it to the battery power.  NO DIFFERENCE.  LOVE this fan.2019 - Had stored the fan without the batteries, over the winter.  Our annual boondocking trip was coming up, so I put in the OLD batteries, still had juice and ran fine.  Get to our location in WI and no electric, which we knew, hence the fan.  So get it out and put in OLD batteries, it ran for about 10 seconds and then faded, then would rev up, then fade to off, then rev up, and kept doing this up and down and when it was running it wasn't much a a breeze.

Fortunately the weather at night was in the 55-60ish range.  This fan ran for 3 nights at about 8 hours each and about 4 hours during the day.  A total of 28 hours.  It is still going.  I have to say this MODEL is much better than a Coleman I had.  My Coleman took 6-8 D cell batteries and barely lasted 8 hours.  And I ran it on high and low settings.  It still has power to run!!!Also I used the AC adapter when I got it to compare it to the battery power.  NO DIFFERENCE.  LOVE this fan.2019 - Had stored the fan without the batteries, over the winter.  Our annual boondocking trip was coming up, so I put in the OLD batteries, still had juice and ran fine.  Get to our location in WI and no electric, which we knew, hence the fan.  So get it out and put in OLD batteries, it ran for about 10 seconds and then faded, then would rev up, then fade to off, then rev up, and kept doing this up and down and when it was running it wasn't much a a breeze.  Purchased NEW 18.00 batteries D and put those in.  SAME THING!  So this year it was much hotter than last year, we were miserable.  I'm sure they won't take this back, we've had it for a year and used it 4 days.  I am soooooo disappointed.  The first use of the fan was fine.  Hope others don't have this issue.  If you do and solved it please let me know how."

Also, you can either use it plugged in with an outlet, or take it with you anywhere as there is a battery compartment  on the back, which I have  yet to test out.

Normally if I don;t like something I just don't review it. But in this case I am going to review this fan because I am pretty angry right now. Why, you may ask?  Because I specifically bought this fan a couple months ago to get ready for hurricane season. It is deathly hot where I live when the power goes out and I thought if I at least had a fan I could get my sweat to evaporate if it happens and cool me off. I plugged the fan in and it worked beautifully. So I put it back in it's box and hoped I'd never need to use it during a storm, but if I did I would have a brand new fan ready to go.When I heard a hurricane was approaching I decided to come here to the reviews and  see how long people were saying a set of batteries would run the fan for. And I happened to read a couple of people saying their battery function didn't work. My stomach sank as I had no time left to prepare. I'd just ordered 75 dollars worth of D batteries specifically to run this fan after going to the store for them and everything was already sold out. Batteries, fans, etc.But Amazon could at least deliver them before the storm. (Later that day I couldn't order anything else without the arrival date being 8 days away due to the storm interfering with traffic and deliveries.) So I quickly put batteries in the fan to see if mine worked or not and to my horror it did not. No matter which way I stuck them in, the fan just will not work with batteries in it. And for those of you saying it does work but the fan can't be plugged in at the same time, mine was not plugged in. The people here saying it isn't working are not idiots. Their fans and my fan just don't work on batteries. I opened 2 brand new sets and neither of them got the fan to come on.So I ended up cancelling the big D battery order and ordering 2 mini little fans that barely put out any air, along with loads of AA batteries to run them. And luckily I was within those few hours that Amazon was still sending out 2 day deliveries because otherwise I'd be facing who knows how long of 100 degree temps without power after the storm comes.Had I not decided to come see what people were saying about how many hours the fan runs on  a set of batteries I'd never have known until my power went off that I had no useable fans. And I'd be sitting on 75 dollars worth of batteries I'd bought for it that I didn't need.That's why I'm writing the bad review. Because I know some of you are trying to find a battery powered fan before the hurricane and if you buy this one there is a 50/50 chance you will get one of the one's that don't work while battery run. To add insult to injury I paid 22 for this fan and it is now 14. And I bought it 2 months ago so the return window is closed.

It has been running constantly last summer into fall (on high) and 3 months so far this year (mid to high setting).I have had no issues with unusual noises, odors, or failures. I've been using the oscillation continuously as well for the last 6 weeks (all day, all night, every day as I did last summer/fall without oscillation) For $40 I consider this a good purchase and would buy another if/when needed.The only improvement suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to increase the range of the remote. You have to be fairly close; approx. 3-foot range directly in front of the sensor on the front of the unit. I haven't needed to change the battery in the remote, however as it runs continually, I'm not using it to turn on/off daily, but this year have occasionally changed the speed between medium and high using the remote.Original rating of 5 stars; no change.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've only had this fan for a couple weeks, but it has been running on high setting 24/7 the entire time without the oscillation. So far (🤞), no noises or issues with functionality.  It does provide a little background sound (like a fan will do) but it's not out of the ordinary/excessively loud. It's used in a respectably-sized bedroom,  not overly large,  but roomy, with a second fan on the other side of the room to create circular air flow while the AC is out.It's July and hot in the south and although fans don't cool the air like AC, I'm not sweltering with this set up.  One is set higher than the other as this one isn't very tall, but also doesn't need a large surface space either.This would be a nice fan for a small office space or smaller bedroom alone with AC.  You do need to point the remote directly at the LED readout (not from the side) for it to respond, but that isn't odd.  The remote came with a battery installed; I can't speak to the longevity of the battery provided yet.  The LED readout is a little bright (white not blue) but isn't a problem for me as it isn't right next to my face.  If used on a bedside table it might be bothersome to some if facing the bed.  It lights up,  but it doesn't ""project"" a lot of light.Speed tests from approx 6' away:Setting 1 is hardly audible,  but useless unless you are right next to it; air flow is miniscule at 6'.Setting 2 isn't much different from 1, but might be fine sitting at a desk with this by your feet or on the desk for slight air movement.  Still extremely quiet.Setting 3 still quite quiet with a light breeze close upSetting 4 start to hear the fan, light breeze close upSetting 5 starts to sound like a fan is actually running and begins to put out air flow many other small fans might on low.Setting 6 slightly higher than 5 in sound and air flow.Setting 7 a bit louder than 6, as some small fans might sound on medium or high with air flow felt 6' away.Setting 8, sound gets louder, but quieter than some fans on medium with a definite breeze 6' away.  It won't blow you over,  but this isn't a shop fan either.  With AC, this should provide air flow in a small room without another fan, or cooling effect up close by the bed or on a desk.With 8 levels, oscillation, REMOTE, & small footprint, if this unit lasts a while it will be worth the $40 price tag. However, if you need a lot of air flow across the room, a large fan (Vornado) or multiple small fans (I also have a stationary 8 or 10"" by this maker for $20) would be recommended.  A small fan isn't going to do the work of a large fan, but this one does a pretty good job for it's size. The few small fans with remotes are more expensive.  The big test is how long will it last. With my continual use, if it lasts thru the end of the summer on high I'll consider it a good buy for the price.  I've had other less expensive small fans that worked great but did not oscillate or tilt (stationary) and certainty didn't come with a remote... or a strange name!

It has been running constantly last summer into fall (on high) and 3 months so far this year (mid to high setting).I have had no issues with unusual noises, odors, or failures. I've been using the oscillation continuously as well for the last 6 weeks (all day, all night, every day as I did last summer/fall without oscillation) For $40 I consider this a good purchase and would buy another if/when needed.The only improvement suggestion I would make to the manufacturer is to increase the range of the remote. You have to be fairly close; approx. 3-foot range directly in front of the sensor on the front of the unit. I haven't needed to change the battery in the remote, however as it runs continually, I'm not using it to turn on/off daily, but this year have occasionally changed the speed between medium and high using the remote.Original rating of 5 stars; no change.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've only had this fan for a couple weeks, but it has been running on high setting 24/7 the entire time without the oscillation. So far (🤞), no noises or issues with functionality.  It does provide a little background sound (like a fan will do) but it's not out of the ordinary/excessively loud. It's used in a respectably-sized bedroom,  not overly large,  but roomy, with a second fan on the other side of the room to create circular air flow while the AC is out.It's July and hot in the south and although fans don't cool the air like AC, I'm not sweltering with this set up.  One is set higher than the other as this one isn't very tall, but also doesn't need a large surface space either.This would be a nice fan for a small office space or smaller bedroom alone with AC.  You do need to point the remote directly at the LED readout (not from the side) for it to respond, but that isn't odd.

As other reviewers have noted, the lower settings (1-3) are very light breeze and very quiet. They’re fine for maintaining some air circulation but don’t help to cool very well. The upper settings are more powerful but also more noisy. The main issue in my eyes is that the fan is very short. When it is set on the floor you can’t feel it at face height, even if you’re sitting in a chair. When placed on a table it can be effective; however, the design results in quite a narrow column of moving air and the oscillation feature is quite a slow sweep. I find that this just doesn’t cool a space (or me) as effectively as something like a round oscillating fan. I bought it for use in my bedroom but have ended up using it on the counter in the kitchen to blow right at me (and only me) while cooking in hot weather.

It replaces a 12 inch box fan that was just too loud.  The fan stands 16 inches tall and is 4 inches wide. The airflow comes out the grill in front and it's a narrow current. You feel the breeze about six feet across. That's perfect for sleeping at night.i tested the noise level. The background noise with nothing on in my bedroom is about 32 dB. When the fan is on at level 4 out of 8 at a distance of 10 feet the sound level is 36 dB.  If the fan is turned up too high at level 8 the noise was at 47 dB.  For comparison my old box fan at low setting was 47 dB and at medium it was  51 dB or more It also rattled and this was very disturbing, where this new tower fan doesn't rattle, and it's a calming breeze sound. One thing to remember, the decibel scale is logarithmic. It means when you go from 32 to 33 dB, that's not one times more noisy, it's 10 times louder. So going from 36 dB with the new fan to the old box fan at 47 dB when it's turn to low setting.

They pressed on the movable part of the fan to check for sturdiness instead of the actual part the actually holds the weight of the fan from the ceiling. This was a small inexpensive ceiling fan mind you. But after only a couple of years it is already not putting out enough air to even feel it.

In the meantime I decided to go back to old school and just get this stand up fan and I am so very glad I did. It is the perfect height, takes up very little space.

I viewed quite a few of these taller oscillating fans purposely looking for a fan that made noise similar to a box fan and yet still had the same power as a box fan.After viewing quite a few and going over reviews and seeing some of these reviews I was a little hesitant but also wanted a noisy fan. I decided to try this fan and I am not disappointed at all. Actually I am totally happy I made this purchase and the remote along with the different modes (not just fan speeds! It has a night mode and a softer breeze mode) and the oscillation so it doesn’t stay stagnant and the noise has me hooked!! The night mode, the fan makes a more prominent fan noise, definitely for people who can’t sleep without the white noise from a fan and it also has a timer feature for the days/nights of hot flashes or night sweats.This fan has really exceeded my expectations and then some!!A must have for people who love to sleep with a fan for the noise and the breeze!! The remote is just the cherry on top."

I use a really large fan at night so wanted a smaller one to just circulate some air during the day & I loved the facts they have remotes & I could easily take them on trips. Plugged the 1st one in, lights came on & it would beep when clicking the button on the fan or remote but no motor noise & blades didn't even try to move. I thought I must be doing something wrong. Finally plugged the second one in after trying everything I could think of with 1st one & never got it to run. The 2nd one came right on so I know I wasn't the issue with the 1st one. Although it did come on, I'm also returning the 2nd one bc it makes a clicking noise. Like when we were young and would put a card on our bicycle tires, it's like that sound. Even though it ran that sound does not give me confidence in it's durability or longevity. Another important thing you should know is the remote has to be pointed DIRECTLY at the base of the fan so if you set it on the floor say at the end of your bed you will have to position yourself to point the remote DIRECTLY at the base for it to work. Also the actual fan part is very cheap. I understand it's to make it light weight but I feel like they could have made the plastic a little more durable without adding too much weight. If traveling with it I would suggest keeping it the box to protect it bc any kinda weight on it will likely break it. I will say, it does move around a good amount of air. I had it approx 10-12' from me & had no problem feeling it. I just don't think it would last long even never moving it but I'd certainly be leery of traveling with it due to it getting broke.

This fan had been running great over the last 15+ years.  When I called the manufacturer, I was told that they didn't have a  replacement blade that would fit my old fan.

Shape = the top half can be moved left or right and blows a different direction than the bottom, where it always seems like it covers far more blow-area than you might ever imagine for my old 14"" fan. My old model only difference to this 4916 model I now confirm was only old one a turnie-knob to select speed/oscillate, rather than this new one with 2 push buttons.  Did I mention my old Lasko lasted 10 years?When I shopped here for a replacement, oh I looked at many brands, all cheaper really.  Good stuff, reviews were good. Some big name recognizable makes, some remotes, some even had the temperature showing on them lol.  I only need to know ""I'm hot"" or ""I'm not hot"" - not a number, so that one makes me laff, but I digress again...So I shopped and shopped.  I found cheaper, but none had that center-swivel thing going for it.  Its a manual thing - nothing fancy, it just really reeeeeally widens the blow-area covered, and in a split-second reach you can adjust it anytime. Lasko was the only one that had it in the 14"" like my old 14"" size, so this I paid just a smidge more for, no remote, no bells whistles, two pushbuttons, manual swivel, same space it will take up standing on the table in the room I need it in.  If you have a small space to use this fan in, you won't believe how much difference that manual-twistie swivel option in the middle makes until you actually use one of these.I got model # 4916 black from this ad.  It arrived identical size as the one I got rid of.  That was still working fine, it just got that musty smell after 10 years is all.* Running, this new one is (the same) whisper quiet, in a tiny little echoey room.  The buttons don't ""beep"" like my tower fans - in the middle of the night - tG.  Had I got a different non-Lasko fan it might have beeped and for some reason I just don't like the ones that do that.  Unnecessary really.  The old one did not beep, the new one/this one does not beep.  It has no remote, but in a tiny room/on tabletop, ya gotta walk by it anyway.* What else matters, I think to self?  It matters that the Lasko fan I got rid of was a decade old, exact model except for knob to push button it turns out, and the old one lasted that long.  I could have saved a few measly single US dollars getting any other 14-inch-ish tall fan I found - with no pivot covering less blow-area - and taken 100% chance the fan wouldn't do ** exactly what I needed it to continue doing **, or I could get this one and hope for quiet, about the same item, and get 'er done as well.  And it did.  I win!I am so glad I thought it out and got this model 4916 Lasko. Shipping was predictable, reliable, packing was great, arrived in new/perfect condition as ordered, to tabletop and plug 'er in and manually swiveled the center of it, and within what was it less than 2 minutes my reliable Lasko was... back.I cannot speak for the 4911 shorter one.  It would have been too short for my same room area-coverage.  I cannot speak for the 4910 which is 14"", but I chose the 4916 instead because I was hoping for the newest model available and getting another 10 years of great Lasko operation, where I can be happy to know:  In the future, save my time, just get the Lasko.

I could have saved a few measly single US dollars getting any other 14-inch-ish tall fan I found - with no pivot covering less blow-area - and taken 100% chance the fan wouldn't do ** exactly what I needed it to continue doing **, or I could get this one and hope for quiet, about the same item, and get 'er done as well.  And it did.  I win!I am so glad I thought it out and got this model 4916 Lasko. Shipping was predictable, reliable, packing was great, arrived in new/perfect condition as ordered, to tabletop and plug 'er in and manually swiveled the center of it, and within what was it less than 2 minutes my reliable Lasko was... back.I cannot speak for the 4911 shorter one.  It would have been too short for my same room area-coverage.  I cannot speak for the 4910 which is 14"", but I chose the 4916 instead because I was hoping for the newest model available and getting another 10 years of great Lasko operation, where I can be happy to know:  In the future, save my time, just get the Lasko.  And now I know I can come back to this seller and get exactly what was promised.  Yay!"

I leave it running for days at a time, and it does run and the air it blows is fairly consistent.  It oscillates with no trouble.  But it's grown louder and louder, it grinds and vibrates even when not oscillating, and my entire desk thrums. I work with A/V and even with my studio cans on at full blast I can hear this fan on low from two feet away.There is zero excuse for this.  Lasko should be ashamed of themselves for this garbage.  I'm furious.Update #2:  It's 17 July and it's hotter than Hades in NYC, and I have had this fan running now since I the day I unpacked it and placed it on my desk.I am sad to say that this item is going to have to be returned, because it's gotten louder and louder and louder with each passing day.  It rattles and thumps and vibrates and makes so much noise I can hardly hear myself think.There is no excuse for this.  None at all.  I am extremely disappointed in Lasko.UPDATE:  I got the new fan yesterday (Sunday 30 June 2019) and it's much, much, much more quiet than the first one. As soon as I plugged the new one in and turned it on, I did a couple minutes' comparing the airflow (identical) and the noise (radically different) and put the first one in the box the second one came in, ready for return. I'm not even going to keep that first one for use elsewhere; the rattling and banging is not normal.That said, the fan is still noisy, just not as noisy as a jet engine being bounced round a room with metal walls. And it does not have a uniform noise quality, either - sometimes it thumps and bumps, sometimes it rattles, sometimes it vibrates heavily, and sometimes it operates smoothly. All of that is not ideal and should not be happening in a well made, quality fan, but here we are. Welcome to the state of the world in 2019.Still, since it's much quieter and the airflow is very good at the close range for which I will be using it (barely two feet from my body), I'm keeping it because it's too hot to futz around.  But when it comes time to replace it, I'll be spending just a little bit more and I'll order two or three different kinds to see which one works the best and doesnt make you deaf in the process.Do better, Lasko.  You are aware of these issues. There is zero reason for them to persist.  One star removed for ignoring known issues and very poor quality control.I generally like Lasko fans. So when the big heat hit this week and my health took a big nosedive, I decided that this summer I would have a desktop fan. After much comparing and contrasting, I chose this little guy, and for only the second time in my life took advantage of same-day delivery. If the heat wasnt making me quite ill, I'd have simply used Prime.First, let me tell you about the fan. Then I will tell you about the fiasco that ensued after I placed the order.The fan itself is a nice little sturdy unit, feels good and solid, well-made, and a small footprint.  The cord is long enough without being a nightmare.  The airflow on the top bit is good and strong on all three speeds, though it blows a very, very narrow column of air - much more narrow than the grates are, so that it has to be carefully aimed if kept stationary. Even a couple inches to one side or the other and you feel no airflow at all. The bottom portion is a much weaker airflow for some reason, which is a bit annoying. The top and bottom portions can be individually adjusted to whichever direction you choose. This is ideal for a hot desk: I can the upper portion of the fan blowing at my face, and the lower portion blowing at my hands on the keyboard as I work. It works out beautifully, and though it could be better, I am extremely pleased with the arrangement.The real downside is the NOISE.I'm not usually bothered by fan noise very much; I understand that fans cannot be entirely silent and the white noise can be very soothing and help with focus and concentration. But this little guy isnt a shop fan and there's no reason for it to be as loud as it is.  This thing sounds like the love child of a lawnmower on bath salts and a crop-duster with engine trouble trying to escape after just having pulled a bank heist.  Holy bananas, this thing is LOUD.And to make matters worse, it's not even just a steady loud hum like a fan. It's a buzzy, high-pitched, whiny loud that varies and oscillates, sometimes higher, sometimes lower, sometimes not present at all. And then there's the rattling and the thumping and the vibrating the desk so that the pencils rattle.  What on earth is the deal with this thing?It really is very, very loud.  Loud. LOUD. So I'm going to see what the other one I ordered sounds like when it arrives tomorrow, and depending on which one is less strident, I will return the other.Which leads me to an explanation as to why my single same-day Friday order magically turned into two fans by Sunday night:A little while after I placed the order, I went to check status to see if it had been processed. That's when I noticed that the final shipper was Lasership, a company I'd never heard of. A quick google revealed that they are a horrible, horrible company who is continually in trouble for outright stealing packages right from pickup with no intention at all of delivering them, and marking them as delivered and insisting that it is the customer's fault they never got their package. A number of very major online businesses use these guys. My friend told me the story of what she repeatedly went through when she ordered her cat supplies through a major online pet retailer that uses/used Lasership and that she never got her deliveries from them and they always insisted the deliveries had been made when they had not.Sure enough, 9pm rolled around (the ""will be delivered by"" time) and no fan. 10:30 pm rolls around and I call Amazon. The dude on the phone was very pleasant and completely unsurprised that Lasership never sent me my package. At one point, his exact words were, ""I would be shocked if it actually ever showed up.""  So he patiently went through the process - he tried calling Lasership but it was ""after their business hours"" and nobody picked up. He talked to his management.  He checked this and that.  Long story short, Amazon made good and at around 10:55pm, we hung up. I had a credit for a new fan which I used immediately and placed the order again for the same fan, to be delivered via Prime for Sunday (tomorrow), and my same-day shipping fee was refunded. Thank you, Logan!At 11:01 pm, I get a notification on my phone from Amazon:  My package has been delivered.

Why are they contracting their package delivery services to a company that has worse customer satisfaction ratings that Somali pirates?  What is wrong with you, Jeff Bezos?  Stop using these nasty tactics and treat your employees better!If I were the kind of people Amazon execs and Lasership are, I'd have remained completely silent about all of this and simply claimed that I never received the first fan at all.

Heck, I might even keep 'em both just to use the other in another location where the noise won't matter quite as much.

I bought it last June.. so it only lasted 1 year. I kept it on my night stand next to my bed. I had a bit of trouble with it on and off. As air stream strength goes it worked really well once I got used to the noise. Because I live in Arizona, dust is kind of an issue with all electronics. I would vacuum my fan every month. I even had my husband take it out to the garage and blow it out  with his air compressor a few times. About 8 months of continuous use it started to have issues. It sounded like one of the blades was off kilter and the fan only moved when we cleaned it. I rarely used the oscillating feature on this fan. When it got really noisy.. enough to keep me from falling asleep, or if it woke me up I would just turn it off.

I bought it last June.. so it only lasted 1 year. I kept it on my night stand next to my bed. I had a bit of trouble with it on and off. As air stream strength goes it worked really well once I got used to the noise. Because I live in Arizona, dust is kind of an issue with all electronics. I would vacuum my fan every month. I even had my husband take it out to the garage and blow it out  with his air compressor a few times. About 8 months of continuous use it started to have issues. It sounded like one of the blades was off kilter and the fan only moved when we cleaned it. I rarely used the oscillating feature on this fan. When it got really noisy.. enough to keep me from falling asleep, or if it woke me up I would just turn it off.

This thing on it's top 2 settings is louder than the 184 on it's highest setting, which is 4-5x larger than this.  While speaking about it's size, it's a little larger than I thought it'd be (and yes, that's even with viewing pictures and reviews), which in some ways is a good thing and in others, not so much.  Does seem to put out quite a bit of air, almost comparable to the much larger 184, at least IMO.  Just definitely louder than I had thought and hoped it'd be.  Also kinda wish it had a remote.  Sure I'll be updating this in the future.."
