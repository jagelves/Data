I can use both by having one blow out one window while the other blows in.This fan ( actually air circulator ) is fantastic. It’s like getting a wind chill in your house.We had some real warm days and I eventually turned on the air conditioning- but I turned it up to 76 ° and pointed the fan directly at the ceiling. It really helped to disperse the cool air that way while not having to turn the air conditioning temperature lower- thereby using less energy.On days where AC isn’t needed, this fan provides a nice breeze with the windows open, blowing that cool air around from outside. ( the house is tight- so when it’s warm in here and a few degrees cooler  outside - this works really well. )Very versatile machine. Can be pointed straight down in winter to disperse warm air, up to spread the cool air- pointing  out the window to exhaust- just a real great circulator all around, with Lasko’s  blue safety plug.I’m enclosing a photo of my Wind Machine. I painted the blue parts white because my decor doesn’t have any blue and I wanted it to blend in rather than stand out. I keep it a room that’s mostly white and seafoam green with a light grey flooring - not the room in the photo.Extremely easy to take apart- the side knobs come off- the handle comes off- easy to clean.Very well built circulator- worked right out of the box. Sturdy and all 3 speeds are powerful. Not real loud even on the highest setting.I get that the cords can’t be super long for a reason but another 10-12"" would give more options for placement since you can not use extension cords with fans or circulators for safety reasons.Still a 5 star 🌟 machine.

You can get about a full 24 hours on one set of batteries (it takes 6 Ds). The fan will still work, but the output lessens as the batteries drain. The noise is still good for sleep, but you’ll need to swap them out to remain cool. We have other battery operated fans that I don’t like as much, and they take 8 batteries. If you have batteries in the fan, it won’t run on a cord. This fan only takes 6, and it will run off of the power cord even if it has batteries in it. It has been good for 6 years, so I’m purchasing another one. Definitely a great purchase!",0.9948,0

As other reviewers have noted, the lower settings (1-3) are very light breeze and very quiet. They’re fine for maintaining some air circulation but don’t help to cool very well. The upper settings are more powerful but also more noisy. The main issue in my eyes is that the fan is very short. When it is set on the floor you can’t feel it at face height, even if you’re sitting in a chair. When placed on a table it can be effective; however, the design results in quite a narrow column of moving air and the oscillation feature is quite a slow sweep. I find that this just doesn’t cool a space (or me) as effectively as something like a round oscillating fan. I bought it for use in my bedroom but have ended up using it on the counter in the kitchen to blow right at me (and only me) while cooking in hot weather.

As other reviewers have noted, the lower settings (1-3) are very light breeze and very quiet. They’re fine for maintaining some air circulation but don’t help to cool very well. The upper settings are more powerful but also more noisy. The main issue in my eyes is that the fan is very short. When it is set on the floor you can’t feel it at face height, even if you’re sitting in a chair. When placed on a table it can be effective; however, the design results in quite a narrow column of moving air and the oscillation feature is quite a slow sweep. I find that this just doesn’t cool a space (or me) as effectively as something like a round oscillating fan. I bought it for use in my bedroom but have ended up using it on the counter in the kitchen to blow right at me (and only me) while cooking in hot weather. Since it has to be close by to be effective, the remote control seems superfluous… and it has to be pointed at the sensor just right… which often necessitates walking over to the fan to get the right angle.

Either way, even when the power was on, it was hot. Like the sun chasing Mario on that one super mario level from when I was a kid hot. I bought two of these and we used them in our room at night, we took them to the buffet in the mornings with us, and we had them by the pool. I probably had 50 or more people, from guests to employees asking me where I got the fans.They pack up small enough to throw in a backpack or beach bag, they hold a charge really well but also will run the entire day if you just connect them to a portable charging brick. We didn't use the remote much but we did use the oscillating function all the time. I was worried the 8 inch wouldn't provide much air/circulation (I couldn't get the larger fan to the house in time for our vacation so I braved the 8 inch). I shouldn't have worried at all, this fan is shockingly powerful especially for how small it is.

Either way, even when the power was on, it was hot. Like the sun chasing Mario on that one super mario level from when I was a kid hot. I bought two of these and we used them in our room at night, we took them to the buffet in the mornings with us, and we had them by the pool. I probably had 50 or more people, from guests to employees asking me where I got the fans.They pack up small enough to throw in a backpack or beach bag, they hold a charge really well but also will run the entire day if you just connect them to a portable charging brick. We didn't use the remote much but we did use the oscillating function all the time. I was worried the 8 inch wouldn't provide much air/circulation (I couldn't get the larger fan to the house in time for our vacation so I braved the 8 inch). I shouldn't have worried at all, this fan is shockingly powerful especially for how small it is.

Shape = the top half can be moved left or right and blows a different direction than the bottom, where it always seems like it covers far more blow-area than you might ever imagine for my old 14"" fan. My old model only difference to this 4916 model I now confirm was only old one a turnie-knob to select speed/oscillate, rather than this new one with 2 push buttons.  Did I mention my old Lasko lasted 10 years?When I shopped here for a replacement, oh I looked at many brands, all cheaper really.  Good stuff, reviews were good. Some big name recognizable makes, some remotes, some even had the temperature showing on them lol.  I only need to know ""I'm hot"" or ""I'm not hot"" - not a number, so that one makes me laff, but I digress again...So I shopped and shopped.  I found cheaper, but none had that center-swivel thing going for it.  Its a manual thing - nothing fancy, it just really reeeeeally widens the blow-area covered, and in a split-second reach you can adjust it anytime. Lasko was the only one that had it in the 14"" like my old 14"" size, so this I paid just a smidge more for, no remote, no bells whistles, two pushbuttons, manual swivel, same space it will take up standing on the table in the room I need it in.  If you have a small space to use this fan in, you won't believe how much difference that manual-twistie swivel option in the middle makes until you actually use one of these.I got model # 4916 black from this ad.  It arrived identical size as the one I got rid of.  That was still working fine, it just got that musty smell after 10 years is all.* Running, this new one is (the same) whisper quiet, in a tiny little echoey room.  The buttons don't ""beep"" like my tower fans - in the middle of the night - tG.  Had I got a different non-Lasko fan it might have beeped and for some reason I just don't like the ones that do that.  Unnecessary really.  The old one did not beep, the new one/this one does not beep.  It has no remote, but in a tiny room/on tabletop, ya gotta walk by it anyway.* What else matters, I think to self?  It matters that the Lasko fan I got rid of was a decade old, exact model except for knob to push button it turns out, and the old one lasted that long.  I could have saved a few measly single US dollars getting any other 14-inch-ish tall fan I found - with no pivot covering less blow-area - and taken 100% chance the fan wouldn't do ** exactly what I needed it to continue doing **, or I could get this one and hope for quiet, about the same item, and get 'er done as well.  And it did.  I win!I am so glad I thought it out and got this model 4916 Lasko. Shipping was predictable, reliable, packing was great, arrived in new/perfect condition as ordered, to tabletop and plug 'er in and manually swiveled the center of it, and within what was it less than 2 minutes my reliable Lasko was... back.I cannot speak for the 4911 shorter one.  It would have been too short for my same room area-coverage.  I cannot speak for the 4910 which is 14"", but I chose the 4916 instead because I was hoping for the newest model available and getting another 10 years of great Lasko operation, where I can be happy to know:  In the future, save my time, just get the Lasko.

So the better half wanted something small and that could be aimed at her while she's working at her computer desk.I did a little bit of looking and saw this, and figured we'd give it a try.  We've used Lasko products throughout the years and they deliver.So far it's not to shabby, as others have said the high setting does give out a bit of noise, but realistically to us its the only setting she likes, well, maybe the middle speed.  The low speed, doesn't seem to push out much air at all.

It worked just fine in the HOT summer but I’m VERY disappointed that this new fan only lasted a few months. I’ve had it for almost a year now, but by September, it was no longer working. I only used it when I’d work and for $30, I expected this to give me at least a year. Instead, I only got (maybe) 4 months out of it. I usually like Lasko fans, in fact, most of the ones I have is Lasko. With this one not making it to 6 months of good use, I’ve started to question purchasing any more of their products. Btw, I tried to “troubleshoot” and there’s just no fixing a dead fan. SMH",-0.7569,0
